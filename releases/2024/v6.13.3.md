## Server

### New

* **/inspect/files**: Added filter by `size`. [1f70d8410]

### Improved

* **Hotfolder**: Prefer `JPEG` over other formats for the same filename. This allows to use recognize version for RAW files and make sure that the JPEG which is uploaded alongside with it gets imported as second. Also, improved merging of nested information in case another version is added. [31397397c]
