## Server

### Important

* This release fixes a regression bug introduced `6.10.0`. The bug broke the search filter in the "Has More..." filter popover dialog. A **re-index** is recommended.

### Improved

* Support `FYLR_CMD_PG_DUMP` and `FYLR_CMD_PSQL` to find helper programs for backup (`pg_dump`) and restore (`psql`). Before these programs where only looked for in `PATH`.

### Fixed

* `fylr convert`: Fixed regression bug for non UTF-8 `.ai` file previews.
* Fixed localisation of server side error messages.
* **/api/search**: Fixed `include` in `linked_object` aggregations. The bug was introduced with the refactor or search and sort field indexing in **6.10.0**. A re-index is recommended.

## Web frontend

### Fixed
* Polyhierarchy: A bug has been fixed where the expert search did not work correctly for polyhierarchical objects.
* Collection Plugin: Corrections have been made to the collection plugin.
* Plugins CrossServer: The loading of plugins in fylr has been fixed when using the cross-server feature with an ez5 instance.
