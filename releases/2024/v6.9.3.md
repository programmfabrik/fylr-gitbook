## Server

### Fixed

* **/inspect/migration**: Use `--max-parallel-upload-files 1` to upload only 1 file at a time to avoid race problems.
* **fylr restore**: Fixed version upload error reporting. This problem could happen when using `--max-parallel-upload-files` > 1.
* **Export / Download**: Support files > 4GB.
* **fylr metadata write**: Use `exiftool -api LargeFileSupport=1` to support files > 4GB for downloads.

## Frontend

### Enhanced
* **Add to collection**: The options to add an object to a collection have been added in new locations, such as in the tools of the detail panel and in the fullscreen detail.

### Plugins
* **Connector Plugin**: Some issues in the connector plugin have been fixed when trying to download files from external instances.
