## Server
## Fixed
- Some **workflows** accidentially ran on DELETE even if not configured to do so.

## Frontend
## New
- A new option has been added in the **mask settings** for **reverse nested tables** to hide the **tools buttons**. This allows hiding the tools button in situations where relational tables are used. Furthermore, if the user does not have the permissions or cannot see any tool, the button will not be displayed.

## Improved
- The **CSS** of the application in general has been improved, including the **PDF Creator** and **PDF printing**.

## Fixed
- An issue has been fixed where **nested elements** with **condensed format** were not displayed correctly.
- The import of **collections** in the **JSON importer** has been corrected for collections that exceed 1000 records.
- A bug in the new functionality for **modifying the thumbnail of a video** has been fixed, when the field to which the video belongs is not visible.
