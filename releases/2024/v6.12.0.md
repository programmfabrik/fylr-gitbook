## Important

* **Forced Re-Index**: This release brings a forced re-index to fix sort problems which may occur on instances using `string` column types and also to make use of the new numeric sort feature. Plan enough time for this update, as the re-index is blocking. Only `/inspect/` is available during while the re-index is running.
* **fylr** does no longer enlarge images if they are smaller than their target size. Affected versions need to be reproduced using `/inspect/files/`. Make sure to **re-sync** the actual version, not the original.
* Text fields are sorted in numeric mode now. Only `string` column type is an exception where the default sorting is alpha numeric as it was before. A re-index is required to make use of this feature.
* This release supports **previews for font files** (`TTF`, `OTF`) and brings improvements for preview generation for vector based file formats. For office files we support a version `PDF` by default.
* **Webhooks** have been changed & improved, if you are using Webhooks, check for details below.
* **Zoomer**: The behavior of the zoomer in the asset browser has been modified. Previously, using the mouse wheel directly on the asset browser would automatically activate the zoomer. Now, this will only occur in fullscreen mode. In the detail/editor sidebar, users will need to click the corresponding button to activate the zoomer.

## Server

### New

* `fylr convert`: New `--enlarge` flag. This forces images to be enlarged even if the source is too small. This changes the default behavior to not enlarge files. A new `enlarge` flag is available in the recipe `browserthumbs` to restore the old behavior for specific versions. \[f5588c93]
* **Login page**: Allow to overwrite the login label on the login page in the base config. \[00041f52]
* **Login page**: Added a `SAML` preferred switch in base config. With this switch on the layout on the login page is more prominently showing the SAML option. \[56caee76, f92b3607]
* **Docs**: Added openapi spec support to /inspect. This is framework only, not much documentation there yet. This will improve over the next releases. \[3b58f901]
* **fylr restore**: New parameter `--datamodel`. Used to overwrite the data model file from the manifest; inspect migration: restore option no\_purge: use --datamodel=- to skip the upload of the data model. \[48fde902a]
* **fylr.yml**: Allow to set environment for fylr using the `fylr.yml`. This is useful on Windows where a system wide environment configuration is not desired by a fylr installation. \[59e976e1]
* **/api/search**: Support `$now` and other placeholders for date searches. In date searches we support `$now`, `$startOfMinute`, `$startOfHour`, `$startOfDay`, `$startOfWeek`, `$startOfMonth`, `$startOfYear`, `$today`, `$month`, `$year` with an optional offsets `+-smhdMwy`. **search/parse** api will replace the placeholders in the search json response immediately. \[bbfd9541]
* **/api/search**: Support `timezone` for date searches. A new parameter `timezone` supports timezone for date searches. With this, the `$now` & other placeholders will be interpreted according to the given timezone. Also, regular dates without timezone will be read for the desired timezone. \[b0aeff6e]
* **fylr convert**: Support preview `TTF` and `OTF` fonts.
* **Poly hierarchy**: Support adding a `Root node` if at least one parent is selected. Before we could not attach a node to the root of the tree as well as to other parents. \[c1846e38]
* **/api/search**: Add `width` to sort option for date sorts. Allowed width is `year`, `month`, `week`, `day`. This this it is possible to sort by dates only checking the year and as a second sort by something else. \[117f6993]
* **/api/search**: Support new subfield for type **file**: `best_date`. Best date is calculated as UTC datetime from `technical_metadata.date_time_original`, `technical_metadata.date_created`, `upload_date`. Whatever comes first. This is also supported in `_fields`. \[d81e9df5]

### Improved

* **Base config**: Allow overwriting of login label on the login page.
* **Exec server**: Improved handling of unconfigured services, do not re-schedule jobs in that case. \[aaa5dfee]
* **fylr.yml**: Configured plugins are no longer enabled by default. The new `fylr.plugin.default_enabled` setting restores the old behavior if set to true. \[4654077]
* **fylr restore**: Updated handling of `--base-config` parameter: independent from `--purge`, not allowed with `--continue`. \[48fde902aa]
* **fylr convert**: Support `-r` to overwrite existing output files. \[3a1ae4a2b]
* **/inspect/files**: New action **resync with metadata**. This new action does what **resync** did before, it re-generates metadata for files, and for that the file needs to be copied from storage to the exec server. The new action **resync** skips that step, so that it is much faster to re-sync files after changes in the file worker configuration in the base config. \[720c7cab]
* **POST /api/db**: New API error `RecordUnmarshalJson` returns structured information about unmarshal errors. \[81d63322]
* **Backup / restore**: Use environment variables `FYLR_CMD_*` to find `pg_dump` & `psql`, tools we require for backup & restore. \[205d72dc, b18e978f]
* **api/v1/db?skipConstraints=1**: Allow multiple tags from `taggroup` with type choice. Fixed multiple tag choices check for version 1. This introduces a new system tag `TAGS_CHOICE_VIOLATION`. \[c14f83d6, eac3f682]
* **/api/db**: Improved `UniqueKeyViolation` error. Add `valuelinkedsystemobjectid` and `valuelinkedstandard` is set in unique key violation errors, if available. \[42ca15ba]
* **Indexer**: Text fields are sorted in numeric mode now. Only `string` column type is an exception where the default sorting is alpha numeric as it was before. A re-index is required to make use of this feature. \[aa07b0aa]
* **fylr convert**: Improved vector files support. This gets rid of our custom `SVG` magic to convince **Imagemagick** to accept sizes bigger than the `SVG` canvas. Now, we use **Inkscape** for that job (creating an interim `PNG`). Changed default produce config to treat `AI`, `EPS`, `WMF` all alike. For them we produce a separate `SVG` version. All vector formats now ignore "enlarge" setting. Also, added `-v` to most recipes for easier debugging. \[457cbdd2]
* **/api/db?skipBidirectionalUpdate=1**: Skips updates of bidirectional objects during inject (used by `fylr restore`). \[3471c981]
* **Email**: Add `X-Fylr-System-Object-Id` to the email headers. This header contains all system object ids which are linked to the email (pulled from the event). \[fb4a2485]
* **Base config**: Use internal cache to avoid re-dial for ldap connections. Do not redial to LDAP servers on each cache expire (like data model updates), but instead use a cache to remember the status of the ldap config. This avoid the re-dial and should make systems with LDAP configured faster when updating base information which requires the cache to expire. \[d3aad68b]
* **/api/search**: Supporting searching for changelog `DELETE` entries. \[cb57d46b]
* **/api/export**: Use metadata timestamp when exporting files, fixed timestamps in `ZIP` and `TAR` archive downloads. This patch uses metadata time stamps **date time original** or **create date** to set the time of an export file. If that is not available, the upload time is used (as before). \[ab748e2a]
* **/inspect**: Output more info about the database connection in inspect: **max connections**, **database version**, **database roles**. \[f61f95b6]
* **SAML**: Support request signing (enable in base config). \[7ba882c2]
* **File worker**: Produce a `PDF` version for office files. \[cb2862cb]
* **/api/db**, **/api/eas**: Introduce a `compiled_props` structured info block which breaks down information compiled in `compiled`. \[cb2862cb]
* **/api/search**: Support **date** and **datetime** for `fields`. This adds missing "fields" support for date fields. The support is returning the actual stored fields, with no further arithmetics applied. \[q74772b34]
* **fylr restore**: Automatically skip already existing objects in the target fylr. \[86850793]
* **Webhooks**: The config `access_token` was renamed to `send_authorization_header`. Existing configurations must be updated. Also a new `include_access_token` was added. This needs to be set if the user access token shall be added to the JSON information send to the Webhook. Before the token was always sent. So, if your Webhook relies on this, make sure to enable `include_access_token`. Also, `HMAC Secret` & `Timeout` have been implemented. With this it is possible to sign a Webhook request for enhanced security. \[ddfcf3b98, 6739a0c17]

### Fixed

* **DELETE /api/config**: Fixed panic if path suffix is empty. \[8fc163d9].
* **Indexer**: Fixed indexing of custom data type text values `null`. Indexing of such values (actual null in a text value of a custom data type) broke the indexer because we tried to index a "" which is not an object. However, the new index mapping requires an object for text, so indexing of "" failed. \[25984442]
* **fylr backup / restore**: Various fixed and improvements for corner case. \[010ce88a]
* **WebDAV**: Fixed WebDAV support with https and basic auth enabled for Mac and Windows clients. \[1a62519f]
* **fylr convert**: Fix converting non UTF-8 `AI` files. If an .ai file is not UTF-8, Inkscape converts this to an invalid `SVG` (header says it's UTF-8 but encoding might not be). Fixed this by ensuring that the output file is UTF-8 encoded (using charset detection). \[9b5b0450]
* **/api/search**: Fixed `include` for aggregations. `include` stopped working after we introduced a new index format for our facet terms (using our own collator). Fixed this by putting back the actual string as part of the facet term so that the facet filter works again using `include`. \[bb9f8718]
* **/api/search\[type=user]**: Added missing `offset` handling. \[8fe8af36]
* **/api/search**: Fixed boundary searches without to/from equals (unbound open range searches). \[bbfd9541]
* **/api/right/preset**: Support `created_at`, `updated_at` fields, fix tag updates and cache invalidation. This fixes saving the tag lists on updated presets. Before we would delete the tag list on update. This bug caused the cache id to not increment on updates which caused frontend to fail. Also, the "position" was saved but not loaded, so this is another bug fixed in this patch. \[3396c8b1]
* **Object type**: Ignore tags & transitions, if not available. This patch skips loading of tags & transitions for object types where the support is no longer or not enabled. Also, tags & transitions do not appear over the api anymore if the support is no longer available. \[32ced8c4]

## Frontend

### New

* **Group Editor**: A new option "Append with leading space" has been added, allowing users to add a space at the beginning of the value being appended.
* **Asset Browser Info**: Support has been implemented for displaying additional asset information. Documents now show the number of pages, and vector files correctly display dimensions.
* **Version Produce Table**: The version creation and management tool in the base configuration has been redesigned to be more intuitive and user-friendly. Versions are now displayed in a more accessible table format.
* **Polyhierarchical Root**: Frontend support has been added for configuring polyhierarchical objects to appear at the top level as well as in other hierarchy levels. Previously, it was not possible to add an object to the top level if it was within a hierarchy. Users can now select the "Virtual Top Level" pseudo-object when choosing the parents of an object.
* **Date Fields Sort**: Support has been added for grouping results sorted by date in the main search. Users can now group results by year, month, week, or day, taking into account the user's timezone.
* **Asset Sort**: A new option has been included to sort results using an EAS field with the "Best date" option. Additionally, results can be grouped using the new date grouping feature.
* **Font Assets**: Frontend support has been added to display and configure "Font" type assets.

### Improved

* **Filter Panel**: The sorting panel interface has been enhanced.
* **Filter Panel**: The layout of the "More..." panel in search filters has been improved.
* **Hierarchy Results**: The functionality of hierarchical list results in the main search and list search has been significantly improved. Now, the hierarchy will expand correctly to show only the elements included in the search results.
* **Base Types Managers**: Improvements have been made to persist the active tab when saving an item, ensuring the active tab remains visible after saving.
* **Zoomer**: The zoomer has been significantly optimized to make server requests more efficiently, enhancing performance in the asset browser and reducing server load.
* **Error Messages**: Error messages related to "UniqueKeyViolation" have been improved, allowing the frontend to display the standard of the object if the error is related to a linked object, making it easier to identify the element causing the error.
* **Asset Browser**: The display of asset information in the asset browser has been improved.

### Fixed

* **Date Fields**: Fixed an issue with handling very large BC dates in date range fields.
* **Date Fields**: Corrected validation errors in date range fields.
* **Right Presets**: Fixed the functionality for sorting right presets and resolved related bugs, adding support for displaying the creation and edit dates of presets.
* **Data Model Manager**: Fixed an issue when attempting to copy object types that included fields configured as bidirectional.
* **CSV-Importer**: Corrected an issue when trying to use number fields as identifiers to create linked objects.
* **Collection Manager**: Fixed a bug causing the collection manager to respond slowly after adding a new collection.
* **Group Editor**: Corrected an issue when trying to save objects with fields marked as "required" in the group editor.
* **Linked Objects**: Fixed an issue where the Standard 2 field was not displaying correctly if it was too long.
* **CSV Importer**: Fixed an issue when trying to import hierarchical objects with parents already existing in the system. The CSV importer could not find the parent object if the field ID was not used.
* **PDF Creator**: Fixed an issue that blocked the application when trying to print using the PDF creator without having the necessary plugin.
* **Connector Plugin**: Fixed an error when running the connector plugin on instances with saved searches.
