## Server

### New

* **/api/message**: Added new `show_always`. With this setting, the message is shown every time the user logs in. [4aa7860f]
* **/api/transition**: New action `change_owner`. This patch adds a new action "change_owner" to our transitions. With the new action, the owner of an object can be set during a workflow. [e1c5a3ef]

### Improved

* **License management**: Allow `buy` versions to use allowed binaries indefinitely (before this was limited to one year). [17b2a684]
* **fylr backup / restore**: Code improvements and minor fixes. [51944243]
* **Date types**: Enforce range limit for dates (from `-292,277,022,399` to `292,277,022,399`). Fixed `from_to` calculation for date ranges for big years. If the integer representation is close to the `int64` limit, the calculation would output the wrong value because the value was cast into float64 before the division. [a370c593] [95055876]
* **Number types**: Enforce range limit for `integer.2` and `number` (from `-9,007,199,254,740,99` to `9,007,199,254,740,99`). [96117de0]
* **/inspect/objects**: Added file counts and sums. Support application/json request. More sorting options. [ba265852] [8c46a4bc] [e8d0b994]
* **/api/search\[/parse\]**: Support unlimited sub searches. Before this was limited to 100 (for **/api/search/parse**) and settable to a maximum of 1000 for the regular search. Now, a `limit: -1` can disable the limit for sub searches (default for **/api/search/parse**). Also, allow `objecttypes`, `offset`, `limit`, `format` set in **/api/search/parse**. [d48bb974]
* **/api/db**: Improved the behavior of group mode `match_merge`. When matching & merging sub nested records, keep old records in sub nested, overwrite only the delivered ones. This patch also improves the check if a nested match & merge actually changed data or not. [d4151f33]
* **fylr restore**: Improved filename cleaning before file upload. [44c4a399]

### Fixed

* **Standard info**: Rendering of standard file was fixed for the case that not setting was set, except the standard info include. This resulted in files previews not showing up in the search result thumbnails and detail view. [744c2ae8]
* **Janitor**: Event cleaning janitor would throws an SQL error if no plugins where installed in **fylr**. [694cf761]
* **Custom Data Type Updater**: Fixed re-index after data update. The patch makes sure that updater changed custom data re-indexed all objects where that data is used. The batch size is now used as outer loop, not the inner loop. So now, the updater is called with actions `start_update`, `update`, `end_update` for every batch. Also, select stale updates. If an update was requested more than a day ago, the updater ignores this and tries again. [fee5a1ba] [a696b27b] [f160f571]
* **/api/message**: Fixed an error which showed when `webfrontend_props` were not or send with `null`. Also, fixed timezone parsing in `start_time` and `end_time`. Also, unsent values are preserved. [f3d01d9f] [7bc7d72]
* **Overlay FS**: Fixed reading modification times if the file comes from disk and not from the **fylr** binary. [65ea86f0]
* **/api/search**: Fixed wildcard searches of type `text` for base types. [29820903]
* **Export**: Fixed file export for the case when `fylr.debug.logTimings: true` was set. Also export boolean `false` values in `XML` and `CSV`. Add `name` to files in XML export. [96117de0] [95055876]
* **/api/events**: Fixed export to `CSV` with more than 100k rows. Also fix searching for big numbers. [d6911675] [19ed6031]
* **fylr backup**: Fixed storing state of `--continue`. Before `--continue` would start over from the first stored object type and not from the last object type stored. Also, fixed storing of collection objects. [b9ca90c4] [ace66549]
* **/api/search/parse**: Set object types for sub searches (`==?`). When executing a sub search this patch limits the object types to the ones which are needed to match the field values of the sub search. This prevents the search from false results, returned by too many search object types inside the sub search. [937d2b49]
* **/api/mask**: Fixed saving for newly created link masks. If a new mask is created and another field is using that as a link mask, the previous code would fail saving it due to database FK violations. This patch reorders the inserts and updates of the data in the way that masks are created and updated before the fields are created and update. [ba30b91d]
* **/api/schema**: Fixed new nested fields order.  When creating new columns in a nested new fields are created in the sub mask. This patch fixes the position of these fields by setting the db column `position` correctly ensuring persistence of the order of the nested fields. [18a10e8c]

## Frontend

### New

- **Reverse Linked Table**: Added a listener for changes to reverse nested objects within the editor. Now, if a reverse nested object is modified outside the editor, the user is alerted, and only the specific field is reloaded, preserving the unsaved data of other fields in the editor.
- **Subsearch Support for Linked Objects**: Added support for complex searches using the new "subsearch" functionality in Fylr. This allows expert searches on linked object fields to include complex queries rather than specific elements. Example: "Find all records whose linked field A has objects starting with 'b'." The search popover now includes a "Select All" option to use the current search as a subsearch.
- **Workflows Manager**: Added frontend support for the new action, "Change Owner."
- **Date Fields**: Added a new option in date field masks called "Avoid BC Conversion." When enabled, negative dates will not convert to BC format. For instance, entering `-1000` will display as `-1000` instead of converting.

### Improved

- **About Fylr Root App**: Enhanced the "About Fylr" popup with links to repositories in the Full Version information section.
- **User Group Selector**: Increased the number of objects requested for displaying groups and users in the UserGroupSelector. Previously set to 100, this limit was too low for large instances.
- **Detail and Editor Asset Browser**: The asset browser now includes assets from hidden fields if they are returned in the server's standard info. Previously, only visible field assets were shown.
- **Collection Manager**: Reactivated event listeners for visible collections in the Collection Manager. Now, if a collection is edited in another session, the frontend automatically updates the displayed collection information.
- **Standard View**: Added the HTML title attribute to `standard_1` and `standard_2`, enabling tooltips with the full value of these fields.
- **Linked Objects**: Enhanced linked object fields in the editor to refresh automatically when another field referencing the same object updates. This ensures consistent data display across fields referencing the same object.
- **Workflows Manager**: Added a fallback for unimplemented actions in the frontend. These actions now persist correctly.
- **Sorting in Search**: Improved the usability of the sorting popover. The header is now fixed while scrolling through a long sorting list.

### Fixed

- **CSV Importer**:
  - Added support for matching target field names for fields inside linked objects using `#` or `.` to indicate the destination field.
  - Fixed functionality for search and match with localized fields. Previously, the importer failed when using localized fields as search criteria.
- **Mask Manager**: Resolved errors when adding a panel mask splitter inside a block mask splitter.
- **Nested Table Popup**: Fixed a bug with uploading assets to the EAS column inside a nested popup in a newly added row.
- **User Manager**:
  - Fixed errors in user searches when using wildcards. Added support for filtering users by email.
  - Resolved an issue where deactivating all visible columns caused the user list to fail to render and broke user search functionality.
- **MaskSplitters**: Corrected rendering issues with mask splitters.
- **Date Range Field**: Fixed a rendering error in the expert search for date range fields.
- **Mask Editor**: Ensured visibility of default custom settings for custom data types without `manifest.yml` configurations.
- **User Templates**: Fixed an issue where changes in editor user templates were not saved correctly.
- **Collection Uploads**: Fixed a bug where the collection counter was not updated when images were uploaded.
- **EAS Importer**: Fixed and improved the import of linked objects created through metadata imports. This affects both CSV and JSON importers.
- **Decimal Fields**: Corrected range validation hints in decimal fields.
- **Nested Popover**: Fixed issues with fields that had validations when rendered in the new nested popup mode.
- **Admin Messages**: Fixed the calendar in date-time fields to use the frontend language.
- **Events Manager**: Corrected an issue where CSV files downloaded from the Events Manager were not renamed correctly.
- **Match and Merge**: Temporarily removed the new Match and Merge option for nested fields in the group editor. This functionality has been hidden in debug mode until further adjustments are made.
- **Frontend Developer Menu**: Fixed the developer menu to prevent unnecessary frontend reloads when settings remain unchanged.
- **Collection Compare View**: Corrected the color scheme when selecting a record in the compare view.
- **Nested Fields**: Fixed several layout issues, including alignment of links or buttons in nested field groups and spacing between nested fields.
- **Asset Placeholder**: Fixed an issue where file extensions were cut off in the asset placeholder.
