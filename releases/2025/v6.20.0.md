## Server

### New

* **/api/task**: New endpoint to run tasks in the background. This first version includes a task module "metadata" which allows to apply mapped metadata to existing objects. The functionality of the new endpoint is described in out [API Documentation](https://docs.fylr.io/for-developers/api/endpoints/api-task). This also includes scheduler functionality to run tasks periodically in the background. [c407e749] [eb55bafe] [7f525428] [59ee9ce3] [51a05d85]
* **/api/search**: Support new property `number_groups` in `sort`. This can be used to group sorting for file sizes by distinct groups. This allows to use a 2nd sort criteria within a group of file sizes like _0 - 100kb_. [c936a6ff]
* **System Rights**: New `frontend_features[upload_without_produce_versions]`. The new right is used to show a checkbox to skip version production for files in the upload dialog. [b3edf2c1]
* **LDAP/SAML**: Support regular expressions in attribute mapping. LDAP and SAML entries can now use regexp to map values to **fylr** properties. The syntax for this is `%(key||search||replace)s`.  Where _search_ is the regexp matching the value for _key_ replacing this with _replace_. Following the Go regexp rules found [here](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp#Regexp.ReplaceAllString). [e1232baa]
* **/api/preset**: Support `default_expiration_hours`. This new field will set a `when` for collections acls, if no `when` is defined. The `when.from` is set to the current time (_now_) and the `when.to` to _now_+`default_expiration_hours`. [0afedd5]

### Improved

* **/api/search**: Support for `_owner.group.id`. This patch brings support to search for group owners. [4d43b1bd]
* **/api/transitions**: Allow saving transitions with no operation, this can be used to disable a transition. [c74574a9]
* **/api/user**: Include `_acl` and `_generated_rights` in /api/user (list mode). [6407ac31]
* **/api/db**: For really big integers, improved range error to return `NumberOutOfRange` instead of `parse int error`. [d5428d35]
* **File queuing**: New index to speed up job picking. Added a missing index to make the next file job picking using an index. Before with long queues the select to pick the next job could be slow (like 2s or so), harming file rendition production performance. [4ea727d2]
* **/api/group**: Use loca key for system group name. If available in the localisation CSV, this patch uses the value for the group's display name instead of the database stored name. This updates group display names in older databases where other terms were used. [f610f3e3] [c10acffb] [10edce60]
* **Base config**: Accept files with `XSL` extension as _XLST_-Style sheets. [036a279f]
* **/api/search**: Added placeholder (e.g. _$now_ or _$startOfDay_) and range support for `_last_modified`, `_created`, `_changelog.date_created` and `_changelog_date_last_update` (last 2 placeholder support only). [095d83e0]
* **/api/event/stream**: Make sending of events more robust if many clients are connected: Drop events if the stream listener cannot process events quickly enough. Before we blocked a Go routine until the event seems a better choice to simply drop the events if the listener cannot read them quickly enough. The channel buffers 100 chunks of 25 events. [3380153e]
* **Custom Data Type Updater**: Re-index less objects. If multiple objects use the same custom data, this patch reduces the amount of queued index jobs by not inserting duplicates into the the indexer queue. [f3a7529e]
* **Base config**: Extends the checks on the file worker configuration to improve the extension checks if source versions are used. [5209b305]
* **/api/group**: Added **displayname** for pseudonymization. Also api is improved to set default to `keep`. [4c65999a] [12bbb2a2]

### Fixed

* **/api/db**: Updated `_owner` fields: check the current object for rights, not the new one. Also, check that group owner is not a system group (which is not allowed). [4d43b1bd]
* **/api/eas/download[zipfile]**: Fixed directory `JSON` output. If a directory from inside a zipfile is accessed, return proper JSON. Before this was broken and returned an empty information Array.  Also, removed HTML response for zipfile directories. HTML makes no sense here as the requests require the access token and would have to be included in the index.html which is undesirable. Now, the response is always in JSON format. [8564430f]
* **/api/search[type=user]**: Fixed `_generated_rights`. This fixes the `_generated_rights` for users by loading the groups for the compilation of the rights. [601a9466]
* **/api/search[type=object]**: In cases where users directly receive rights via ACL (not via group), the `_generated_rights` would be wrong. [6407ac31]
* **Login Page**: Fixed rendering issue in Safari. [a499c735]
* **/api/event/stream**: Avoid (harmless) panic & improved send. This patch also avoids a fylr panic ("send on closed channel") which occurred when fylr tried to broadcast to an already closed channel. [3380153e]
* **Notifications**: Avoid (harmless) error "Not enough information to build select clause." [a97f3158]
* **Messages**: If messages are configured to be **always shown** it was possible to create a never ending loop of messages. Now the user will see the always shown message again only after one minute has passed. [2055c087] [cb54c2c9]
* **fylr metadata read**: Run _exiftool_ on closed file. On Windows we have problem with the new exiftool (>13.10) where it cannot open an already opened file properly. Our "fylr metadata read" tool would keep the file opened so that on Windows we got errors. The fix here is to close the file before running exiftool. [dd04fa99]
* **Execserver**: Close file handle on `file_in` before executing commands. This fixes calling a newer exiftool on Windows which needs exclusive access to the file scanned. [065385e6]
* **/api/db**: Fixed **unique key** checks on **parallel inserts**. Before this patch it could happen that parallel inserts inserted objects which violate fylr's unique key constraints. The reason we cannot use the database for that enforcement are schema upgrades where a unique key is added to data which would violate the constraint (for this case a system tag indicating the violation is set).

## Frontend

### New
- **Background Task Manager (Beta)**: A new manager has been added alongside the Export Manager to handle background tasks. From this new manager, users can create, edit, or delete background tasks. Additionally, a new context tool has been added in Search to create background tasks directly from the search view.  
- **Produce Version Checkbox**: A new checkbox has been added to the file upload process, allowing users to skip the creation of asset versions for uploaded files.
- **Pinned Facets**: Added display of the `objectType` next to the name in pinned facets for field facets. Introduced a customization option for pinned filters.  
- **Group Categories Tooltips**: Introduced tooltips for groups with categories, showing all assigned categories on hover.  
- **CSV Importer**: Added support for multi-nested values in "Date Range" fields. Users can now include multiple nested values in the same "From" cell.

- **Boolean Field**: Updated the boolean field view in the editor to always display “Yes”, improving clarity.  
- **Change History (Detail View)**: Enhanced contrast for added, modified, or deleted colored fields for better visibility.  
- **Standard Path**: Paths now wrap to a new line fluidly by default. In standard result view, paths are truncated to a single line.  
- **Presentation**: Made top-left corner buttons easier to access by separating the hoverable area from the overview element.  
- **Search Panes**: Optimized horizontal overflow handling for main search panes.  
- **Search Input**: Improved parsing of query input to correctly apply `OR` and `AND` operators.  
- **Coin Viewer**: Refined placeholder label handling for invalid Coin Viewer JSON files.  

### Fixed
- **Geo-JSON**: Fixed an issue where the map in the main search initialized without a width.  
- **Display Field Values**: Fixed an issue in the plugin that prevented loading owner fields when Groups were used instead of Users.  
- **File Worker**: Fixed the list of extensions in renditions configured with a source version other than "Original".  
- **Detail Fullscreen View**: Ensured fullscreen header buttons remain visible by adjusting the z-index.  
- **Workflows Validation**: Fixed silent error in `getSaveData` method in `TagTransition`. Also resolved issue where multiple warning icons appeared in invalid workflows.  
- **Read-Only Mode**: Disabled hotfolder drag-and-drop and prevented adding new objects to collections in read-only mode.  
- **Main App**: Fixed error when dropping a file into the main app.
- **Query Element Field Editor**: Fixed rendering issues with fields requiring a search instance.

  - Fixed zoom button positioning within presentation slides.  
  - Fixed hidden zoom percentage label (e.g. “40%”).  
- **Tag Form Filter**: Corrected grid layout for 5-column display in the "State after Saving" view in Tag Manager > Workflow.  
- **Facet Manager**: Removed the border of the last facet branch before the next sticky-header "category".  
- **Sidebar**: Fixed minimum size handling of the asset browser to prevent it from becoming too small.  
- **Mask Preview**: Fixed STANDARD preview rendering in the Mask Editor when a real object is selected.  
- **Search Input**: Corrected handling of boolean filter types for `OR` searches.  
- **Change History Diff View**: Fixed error caused by accessing null properties during diff calculation.  
- **CSV Importer**: Fixed unhandled error when importing linked objects via CSV.
