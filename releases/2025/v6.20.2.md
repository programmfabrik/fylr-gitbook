## Server

### Fixed

* **/api/config**: Fixed access to paths containing `*`, `:` and `\`. These characters, when used in escaped form in a path segment, would cause a _BaseConfigPathNotFound_ which was wrong. Now the path is correctly scanned and used. [848d49e5] [278d41db6]

## Frontend

### Fixed

* **Search Input**: A bug in the search input that caused the boolean operator NOT to not work correctly has been fixed.
* **CSV Importer**: Fixed an issue where Date Ranges could not be imported using the CSV importer if they were not inside a nested field.
* **Group Pseudomization**: The department column was removed and a new colum "Additional info" was added.
