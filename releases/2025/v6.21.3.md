## Server

### Fixed

* **Export / Indexer**: Fixed filename sanitization. If a filename exceeded 100 characters including non-ASCII, fylr would panic while rendering the filename. The new limit is 240. [0369c4c3] [7359df27]

## Frontend

### Fixed

* **Custom Data types**: Fixed the `hasValue` support check for custom data types.  
* **GeoJson**: Added support for `unset/hasValue` expert searches on GeoJSON columns.  
* **Detail Hierarchy**: Fixed an error that occurred when displaying reverse hierarchy objects in the detail hierarchy panel.  
* **Objectype Manager**: Resolved an issue in the Object Types Manager where outdated data for non-existing fields was still present. The manager now checks for and clears any obsolete data before saving object type changes.
