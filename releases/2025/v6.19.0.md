## Important

This release **forces a blocking re-index**. Make sure to plan enough time for this update as your users will not be able to access the database while the re-index is running.

## Server

### New

* **Startup**: New fylr.yml config `fylr.elastic.startupConnectTimeSec`. This new config allows to configure the seconds fylr tries to reach the indexer at startup. Defaults to `50`.
* **Export / OAI/PMH**: Add option to embed linked objects which are in main search. We already had embed linked object if not in main search, this adds the variant to embed linked objects if they are in main search. \[493502db]
* **Custom Versions**: Support `WEBP` for custom downloads and exports. Also adds a new parameter `--webp-quality` to fylr convert. \[62bc077f]
* **/api/collection**: Added `_count_recursive` as a new property sibling to `_count`. The new property contains the number of objects links in the collection and all its descendants. \[fb0c3539]
* **XSLT 3.0 support**: Migrated the XSLT processor from [**xsltproc**](http://xmlsoft.org/xslt/xsltproc.html) to [**saxon**](https://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation10/using-xsl/xslt30.html). We use **Saxon-HE** in the **fylr** Docker image. Contact us if you need streaming support for **Saxon-EE**. \[d9787d68]

### Improved

* **/api/db**: Performance improvements for huge databases. \[31ad5110] \[72894b6e] \[d1f03b6c]
* **/api/db**: Speed up loading reverse objects, improved loading of objects in **GET /api/db**, **GET /api/db\[list]**, after **POST /api/db**. The improved loading contexts skip reverse and other flags if not needed by the format. Also, skip reverse loading with url parameter `skip_reverse_nested` (in `POST`, was already like that for `GET`). \[2737c17c]
* **/api/export|eas/download**: Support `quality` in custom versions. Support for parameter `quality` was missing from easydb 5. This patch adds this back. In easydb 5 it was named `jpeg_quality`. \[b1d831e2] \[214b6788] \[cd15f7d9]
* **/api/search**: Added `.range_year|month` subfields for `daterange`, `date` & `datetime`. Enable range support for `date` & `datetime`. We had this for `daterange` already. \[fe26104f]
* **/api/search**: Added support for system field in reverse nested. Requires a re-index. \[7d3de23d]
* **/api/search\[type=event]**: This is now only allowed with system right `system.api.event[get]`. \[9290459d]
* **/api/search**: The filename without extension was added to the full text index (required re-index). \[a9f655da]
* **Notifications**: The notification cleanup can cover more cases now. The case is that a transition action has been removed before a notification caused by it was sent out. \[46862bd8] \[77b7dca4]
* **Startup**: Output error message if plugin glob path could be found. Before this was silently ignored. \[79473b04]
* **Page: Service Unavailable**: Removed link to home. \[45450339]
* **File worker**: New recipe parameters for more compatible `MP4` renditions. This will be applied to new uploads or if file renditions are re-produced using `/inspect/files`. \[ae2d5f45]
* **File worker**: Recognize `webdvd.zip` extension (to enable client support). There is no `webdvd.zip` support in fylr, but with this patch, the extension is recognized (in class `office`), so that we can support the existing frontend **WebDVD player**. \[4cf13eb7]
* **Reverse Proxy**: The reverse proxy will now set `x-forwarded-*` headers as described [here](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httputil@go1.24.1#ProxyRequest.SetXForwarded). \[d655f3fa]
* **WebDAV Hotfolder & PUT /api/eas?collection**: Support nested `create_version` and improve update match. With `create_version` uploaded assets can be appended to an existing nested. Also, the matching for filenames is now word based for the value, so a filename like _bergsee.jpg_ will match in _bergsee.jpg; another.jpg_. The separators are comma, semicolon and newline. Spaces are trimmed. \[46537e6a]
* **CSV Export**: Render hierarchy standard info into `_path`. Before this was only including ids. \[fa740966] \[ee50a52d]
* **Extension Plugins**: Relax error parsing for improved `statuscode` detection. If a plugin returned `{"code": "some.error", "err": "custom error", "statuscode": 400}`, the `statuscode` response would be `500`, because the error was parsed as api error in strict mode and api error has no `err` property but `error`. This patch relaxes the strict parsing, so whatever is found in the responded error json is parsed into api error and, if `statuscode` is set, returned to the caller. Also, the `X-Fylr-Error` and `X-Fylr-Error-Code` headers are set if an api error is found in the response json with properties `code` and `error`, resp. \[0c7823ce]
* **fylr convert**: Support capitalized extensions. \[a99a9d07]
* **fylr backup / restore**: Various improvements & fixed. \[f9b52617] \[34966ba3] \[c2a28539] \[05c1f085] \[4ec96cb1] \[ce882db8] \[944aa1cb] \[2b65a076] \[50f7de7e] \[aa0c31ef]

### Fixed

* **/api/db**: Fix crash bug in reverse self linking case. In a specific case where a reverse linked object would be used together with a bidi linked objects linking to itself, fylr would crash. Also improved detected of illegal paths in hierarchies. \[f67de25c] \[5ad30714]
* **/api/db**: Fixed a case where saving wasn't possible because of missing mask system rights. \[16a54b5f]
* **/api/db**: Fixed importing object types without mask. \[8ac1ab92]
* **/api/right**: Don't output rights from disabled plugins. \[ca1f62e3]
* **/api/export**: Write `FILE_DOWNLOAD` events if files are downloaded via `ZIP` or `TAR` files. \[e2e121aa]
* \*\*/api/export: Prevent recursion in XML export. Cases using bidirectional nested, could lead to **fylr** crashing (stack overflow). \[a2c29611]
* **Event listener**: This patch fixes a problem in event broadcasting which could lead to contention and made **fylr** unresponsive to **POST /api/db**. \[ed7874de]
* **Janitor**: Fix removing remote addresses from events. The base config `event_remote_addr_expire_days` was never properly read from the config system and thus no remote address ever got deleted by the janitor on any **fylr**. \[27e9d682]

## Frontend

### New

* **Core Event Manager**: Moved the **Admin Event Manager** code from the\
  event-manager-plugin to the core app. The manager it is now available without\
  requiring an additional plugin. See #75531

  subfields for date-based columns to improve date-range filters and expert\
  searches. See #75418

### Improved

  in the admin event manager. See #75531
* **Export Custom Version Quality**: Added a new “keep” option to the quality\
  selector (JPEG/WebP) so the original quality remains unchanged. See #75439
* **QueryElementGeoBoundingBox**: Added support for storing bounding box search\
  data so such searches can be saved and restored. See #33713

  elements and limited the “one-line” style to standard result cards (search) and\
  used a multi-line style elsewhere. See #75625
* **Collection Upload Settings**: Strengthened validation of the `update_policy`\
  field in the collection upload settings. See #74790

* **Message Types**: Changed the order of message types for improved clarity in\
  the messaging interface. See #72818
* **Plugins Manager**: Page now auto-reloads after a plugin is installed and\
  enabled, streamlining the setup process. See #75305

  “wait” block, preventing flicker (especially useful in map- based searches). See\
  \#33713
* **ResultDynamic Rendering**: Improved how dynamic objects render in`ResultDynamic`, so the DOM only updates when new data is ready, reducing\
  flickering. See #33713
* **Editor-Templates-Customize**: Optimized data table views inside smaller\
  pop-ups. See #75423
* **Tag Filters Popup**: Centered checkboxes, removed unnecessary scrollbars,\
  and allowed the popup to grow if table labels get wider. See #75428
* **Asset Download Confirmation**: Admin Messages now include asset IDs and\
  classes for all requested downloads in confirmation events. See #74668
* **Plugin Manager (Add Plugin Form)**: Added an “Enable” checkbox in the Add\
  Plugin form so plugins can be enabled immediately upon upload. See #75305
* **GeoJSON Column**: Added a new combo box to the geoJSON field editor,\
  allowing for faster feature creation (e.g., parsing points in multiple formats).\
  See #33713
* **Metadata Browser**: Added support for a multiline label with “read\
  more/less” in the metadata table for asset info. See #74937
* **Standard Path Tooltip**: Added a tooltip showing the full path in the\
  standard path element. See #75625

### Fixed

  handling of filtered assets. See #75604
* **Change History**: Fixed loading of the latest object version in comparison\
  mode to ensure consistent diff structures. See #75017
* **Expert Search**: Fixed errors when opening the expert search if certain\
  parent fields were not initially visible. See #75489
* **Date Filters**: Removed a duplicate day aggregation that led to unexpected\
  hierarchies. See #75418
