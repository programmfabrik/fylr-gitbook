## Server

### Fixed

* **Docker fylr-server**: The docker image was missing TLS root certificates which broke SAML connections to Azure. Also, include `curl` and `jq` as sysadmin tools. [50edea79]

## Frontend

### Improved

- **Search Input**: Added support for 'Exact Token' searches directly in the search input by enclosing the token in backticks (`). Previously, this type of search was only possible using the autocomplete suggestion. #74317
- **Open In New Tab**: The new "Open in new tab" functionality introduced in version 6.17.1 is now available in the contextual menu of linked objects. This feature allows opening the linked object in a new browser window. #75028 

### Fixed

- **Lists Deep Links**: Fixed the behavior of deep links in list mode. Previously, if an object was available in the main search, it would be displayed there even if the URL specified list mode. Now, the object will correctly appear in list mode when specified in the URL.
