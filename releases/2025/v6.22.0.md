## Important

* A re-index is recommended if you have problem indexing documents with
  **GeoJSON** data. This version introduces an Indexer mapping where invalid
  GeoJSON data is ignored rather than causing an error.
* This update invalidates all user entered **collection pin codes**. Due to a
  changed database storage format, we need to invalidate all pin codes entered
  by users.

## Server

### New

* **SAML**: A new options in the base config allows to redirect immediately to
  the **IDP**. The `https://fylr-domain/login` can be used to show the **fylr**
  login page. Also support **pick first** attribute: If an attribute is replaced
  like this `%(mail|email)s`, fylr now uses the first entry which is not empty
  as replacement. [aa27add52] [cd0fb71e9]
* **Renditions**: Support thumbnail extraction for `INDD` (Adobe Indesign)
  files. This supports the first page only at the moment. [1ccec69b0]
* **/api/search**: Support [`geo_shape`] filter for searches. Documented for
  [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-geo-shape-query)
  and
  [Opensearch](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/query-dsl/geo-and-xy/geoshape/).
  [991e88c76]
* **Export CSV**: Add support for changelog export `_changelog`. [dbccd7bbd] [faad9847f]
* **Export XLSX**: Support for Microsoft Excel native format has been added.
  This includes the possibility to add a thumbnail to the sheet. [e85f263e8]
* **DELETE api/db**: Support `delete_policy=undelete` and `delete_policy=purge`.
  This extends the file api to show status `deleted` for deleted files.
  [8547071fd]
* **Janitor**: Support file and object removal. This patch adds janitor support
  to purge deleted objects from the database. The janitor file and object
  removal is not active in this patch unless
  `fylr.debug.janitorEnableObjectAndFileRemoval` is set in `fylr.yml`. The next
  release will enable this by default. [8547071fd] [b2e577bb5] [87e60d6d2]
  [8f60c5690] [5c57e8b5b]
* **Task Module "search"**: Searches for objects and send out (the standard)
  email. [a1ea9584b]
* **/api/db**: Support lookup ids in group mode. [f83481ae3]
* **SAML**: Add customizable Service Provider Entity ID. Also, Javascript can
  now be used to prepare and IDP delivered entry before the user mapping.
  [fcc3473f3] [729783855]

### Improved

* **/api/search**: A new `fylr.yml` config
 `fylr.debug.indexerNestedNotIncludeInRoot` can be used to switch nested index
 behavior to not include nested fields in the root document. [42c31358c]
* **/api/task**: Include task log in email (omits level **debug**). [8b6f0573a]
  [a1ea9584b]
* **Export**: Include `_standard` of parent in CSV exports. [3b9c56629]
* **Renditions**: Introduce the backend tool
  [**VIPS**](https://www.libvips.org/). **VIPS** uses less memory and is in many
  cases a lot faster than the previously deployed
  [**Imagemagick**](https://imagemagick.org/). The new tool will only be applied
  to newly uploaded files and if triggered manually via `/inspect`. [f97c19b45]
  [c12444fd8]
* **File metadata**: Don't compile Blurhash for **originals**.  This change
  affects how originals are compiled. Now, we always skip the Blurhash.
  Frontends can use the Blurhash of the version it wishes to show. This saves
  time and memory during metadata extraction. Also, **fylr metadata read**
  `--blurhash` now defaults to 5M (was unlimited). Unlimited can be activated
  using `0`. This prevents in some environments a too high memory consumption
  during metadata extraction. [9a12956b0] [820a000a4]
* **Renditions**: Don't store Colorprofile in system temp folder, but in work
  folder. Force maximum size for `WEBP` and `JPEG` formats. [1ccec69b0]
  [80815ab4c]
* **Renditions**: Ignore `--size-minimum` if the original has no width and
  height. This will produce all renditions for vector formats. Before, only
  version `small` was produced (default produce config only). [55f3fe757]
* **fylr convert**: Optimized generating `PDF` previews. For PDFs with big
  images in it, using a fixed target resolution of _150_ would consume too much
  memory. Fix this by using the technique from **fylr pdf2pages** where the
  actual page sizes & resolutions are properly calculated. This sets a default
  size of _2000_ when generating the preview (can be overwritten using
  `--size`). [c9450e251]
* **fylr convert**: Support `--no-vips` and set maximum for `--size`.
  [80815ab4c] [f97c19b45]
* **fylr backup / restore**: Various bug fixes and improvements. [291d60a31]
  [becdd34ab]
* **/api/mask**: Add `search_user_hint_localized` to fields. [fec603fdd]
* **/api/search**: Support `"type": "in"` with `null` for `geo_json` columns.
  [6ac0aea9c]
* **/api/search**: Skip unloadable objects. If the index contains objects which
  cannot be loaded (because they were purged), this patch skips these objects
  and avoid a **ObjectNotFound** error. [8547071fd]
* **/inspect**: Whitelist information which can be retrieved from `/inspect`
  using the `Accept: application/json` http header. [9adf38504] [2fdfa3a8d]
  [5c0db6317] [a0eea3534]
* **/inspect/system/janitor**: When running the janitor manually, execute only
  the shown items, not more. Before, the janitor would run until no further
  items needed processing. [8547071fd]
* **Webapp**: Allow to redirect localhost and skip anonymous login. If you use
  `https://fylr-domain?login`, the app redirects to the login page and does not
  anonymously login. [f0b40f7df]
* **Base Config**: Format language strings differently. Language translations
  are now in the form of **&lt;localized language&gt; (&lt;bcp 47 key&gt;)**.
  [32d139f85]
* **Collection pin codes**:  This change keeps pins separated by browser id. The
  browser id is stored in our cookie `fylr-browser-id` and unique in every
  browser. With this change, an anonymous share link with pin code will require
  each unique browser to re-enter the pin. With this, the link can be shared
  more easily between different users. Before, only one user needed to enter the
  pin to enable the link for all others. [62a3e68f5]
* **Task module "metadata"**: New option `overwrite` lets the user overwrite
  existing metadata. If unset, a merge is applied and no existing data will be
  overwritten. Older versions of **fylr** would overwrite by default.
  [a1ea9584b]
* **Plugin scheduler**: Removed plugin scheduler support from **fylr**. This
  feature was never promoted and is now superseded by background tasks.
  Currently background tasks cannot be extended by a plugin, but this will be
  possible in the future. [5280af1d3] [a53b6a183] [ece9105e0]
* **Systemright removed**: `frontend_features[upload_without_produce_versions]`
  was removed. This feature needs more work and concept, so for now it has been
  removed from **fylr**. [5abbbf62f]
* **/api/task/module**: Add `debug` property to mark a task module as _debug_.
  Frontends are to hide such modules by default. Also, add language `und` with
  the localization key as value for easier translations and always trim values.
  [c3f3b790f] [43090d5a0] [f55ec5dd5]
* **License**: Add support for `capabilities.kubernetes`. [b8ffe1f66]
* **CSV & XLSX**: Sort system columns first and user columns alphabetically. [11214ef9a]
* **/inspect/objects**: Fixed and extended versions filter. [c2b2a0e56]
* **GET /api/config**: Require at least `system.config`system right for most
  items. Only selected items will be shown to users without this system right.
  [25fe4c52e]

### Fixed

* **Indexer**: Ignore malformed `GeoJSON` during indexing. Also, don't index
`GeoJSON` inside nested. This is a restriction by the Indexer that we cannot
index geo_shapes inside any nested (well , we can only index one item, not
many). There is other solutions to fix this, but this one is a simple approach
by simply not indexing these fields. This avoids errors which lead to unindexed
documents.  [42c31358c]
* **Renditions**: Fixed setting of background for renditions with clipping path.
  [06fe80842]
* **/api/config**: Fixed setting defaults in forms & tables. The setting of
  defaults in forms and table types was not working. Also fixed a typo to output
  "default" in `/api/config/list`. [4a33f6d82]
* **Standard**: Fixed standard rendering for some cases where a linked object
  was used inside a nested and then wrongly skipped in the top level.
  [034926c12]
* **Standard**: Skip invalid **GeoJSON** when indexing `_standard`. If
  `_standard.1.geo` contains invalid geo json, this patch fixes the Elastic
  mapping to ignore this. Before we only ignored this for the actual geo field,
  but not in standard. This fixes indexing objects which contain invalid geo
  json data. Requires a re-index to take effect. [7b9a05808]
* **/api/db**: Fixed bidirectional case with limited masks. If a bidirectional
  save uses a non standard mask, this patch makes sure the updated bidi object
  is using the all fields mask which skips the "mask" right check on the
  bidirectional object. This avoids error `ObjectInsufficientRights`.
* **User Management**: Lift requirement to have a `reference` for **SAML** and
  **LDAP**. This constraint was there since the beginning of ldap/saml
  implementation, we forgot to remove it after the introduction of update field
  `login` and `email`. [9280bb6ca]
* **POST /api/db**: Ignore tags for object types with turned off tag management.
  This patch fixes the problem that tags for an object are loaded even if an
  object type has lost his tag management (new database version) and this was
  also used for rights management checks. Now, the rights management requirement
  to match tags is ignored. This fixes cases where objects could not be stored
  because of set tags on an object type with no tag management. [437d32986]
* **/api/db**: Avoid panic during unique key error compilation. [fec449ef7]
* **IIIF Manifest**: Fixed to comply to the spec, use unique annotation id. [7119601d4]
* **/inspect/system/janitor**: Fixed display of to be deleted files. [5c57e8b5b]
* **fylr backup**: Fixed backup for rights presets. [0c99eca17]


## Frontend

### New

- **Trashbin Manager**: A new manager has been added to the application to handle deleted objects. If the user has the appropriate permissions, this manager will appear at the bottom of the side menu. It allows users to view, restore, or permanently delete trashed objects. Additional enhancements in the detail panel now indicate when an object is in the trash.
- **User Preferences**: A new section called **User Preferences** has been introduced in both the user manager and the user's top bar settings. This section centralizes general frontend settings that were previously hard to find or not exposed. Initially, it includes two settings, with more planned for the future.
- **Auto Full Screen Mode**: Fylr now includes an automatic full-screen mode that opens the detail/editor view in full screen when interacting with a search result. The detail sidebar is also shown by default in this mode. A new button has been added to the fullscreen editor to quickly switch between detail and editor views. This feature can be enabled via User Preferences.
- **Plugin Manager Configs**: The Plugin Manager now includes a new tab to configure the selected plugin directly—no need to open the base config manager. It also allows exporting/importing the specific plugin configuration as JSON.
- **Restore Change History Object Tool**: A new tool in the change history view allows users to restore a previous version of an object (excluding reverse fields). The restored version acts like a template and can be reviewed and edited before saving. Currently, this feature is only available to users with root access.
- **Geo-JSON Expert Search (requires Geo-JSON plugin)**: Adds support for the `geo_shape` filter type to the `geoJsonColumn` expert search field. Users can now search for documents within polygonal shapes.
- **Include Changelog in Exports**: Adds a new `include_changelog` option when exporting to CSV via the export manager.
- **Hierarchy Filters** The filter manager now displays filters for the entire hierarchy in search results when hierarchy mode is set to "automatic." This means subnodes are aggregated. In "top-level only" mode, only top-level filters are shown. Table view always uses automatic hierarchy.
- **Field Hint in Expert Search**: You can now configure hints for fields that appear in expert search, similar to the editor and detail panel.
- **Admin Messages by Client ID**: Admin messages can now be filtered by the current client ID.
- **XLSX Support in Export Manager**: Adds support for exporting to `.xlsx` format, with the same options as CSV plus an option to include a thumbnail in each row.
- **Sort Manager Enhancements**: The Sort Manager now displays all available object types in the search—not just shared fields. Sorting criteria can now be customized per object type, enabling finer-grained control when filtering.
- **Deleted Asset Placeholder**: The frontend now properly displays placeholders for assets deleted by the Janitor.
- **Collection View All Hierarchy**: A new context menu option allows users to view both a collection's content and its visible sub-collections in search.
- **Standard and Text Views in Lists**: Adds support for standard and text views in Lists and Trash Managers if the selected object types are configured as visible in the main SearchList.

### Improved
- **Janitor Configuration**: New configuration options for the Janitor have been added in both the ObjectType Manager and Pool Manager. These allow overriding Janitor settings per object type or pool.
- **Plugin Manager List Improvements**: Major improvements to the plugin list UI: added filters, sortable headers, and new sorting logic that places active plugins at the top for better usability.
- **Zoomer**: If no version exists that matches or exceeds the original's size, the original version will be used for zooming (if valid).
- **Table View**: Now supports displaying geo-json column fields.
- **Main Search Layout**: The main search layout has been improved. If available, the Map Search Manager now appears on the left side.
- **Fylr License Manager**: Adds support for showing plugins that require a license.
- **Geo Has Value**: Adds support for `unset`/`has value` expert search filters for geo-json columns.
- **Inserted Today Query**: The checkbox for showing objects created today has been moved to the new User Preferences.
- **Tag Management Tool in Search**: Improved error handling: workflow-related errors now display correctly.
- **Metadata Task Module**: Adds new options to the **Metadata** module in the background task manager.
- **Hide Nested Tables in Sort Manager**: New option to hide nested tables in the Sort Manager.
- **Sources Filter Support**: `sid` and `collection` query elements now respect the sources search filter.
- **Event Manager Enhancements**: General improvements to various event types in the Event Manager.
- **Expert Search UI**: Better rendering of nested tables in expert search.
- **Collection Context Menu**: Improved context menu logic to show the appropriate tools for collections.
- **Session Tray App**: Improved display of user settings in the top bar.
- **Instance Capabilities**: Instance capabilities are now loaded with the session, enabling conditional features (e.g., geo-json support).

### Fixed
- **Plugin Manager**: Various fixes for plugin management.
- **Base Config**: Fixes incorrect default value display for `form` type base config fields.
- **Reverse Nested Mask**: Fixes syncing issue for `nested index` mask property on reverse nested fields of the same object type.
- **Request Class**: Fixed an issue preventing external libraries from using the native JS `Request` class.
- **Sticky Headers**: Fixed an issue where sticky headers were not rendering properly in some cases.
- **Map Search Manager**: Fixes for errors occurring in main search when Geo-JSON plugin is not installed.
- **Expert Search Popover**: Fixes scrolling issues in the expert search popover.
- **Blurhash on Assets**: Now uses the blurhash from the rendered version instead of the original, which may not have a blurhash.
- **Filter Manager**: Fixes an error when filters are requested without aggregations.
- **Table View Search**: Fixes a bug that incorrectly opened nodes during table view searches.
- **Data Model Manager**: Corrects the delete confirmation message for object types in Fylr.
- **Editor Sidebar Listener**: Fixes a bug where editor event listeners remained active after closing the sidebar.
- **Group Editor Save Button**: Fixes the save button state when changing bulk options.
- **Change History View**: Various bug fixes and stability improvements.

## Plugins
- **Geo-JSON Plugin**: The first public release of the Geo-JSON plugin is now available. It enables interactive work with geo-json fields, geospatial searches, and more. Visit the [public repository](https://github.com/programmfabrik/fylr-plugin-geo-json-public) for installation and documentation. **Important:** Users of earlier versions should upgrade to the latest release to ensure compatibility with recent Fylr updates.
