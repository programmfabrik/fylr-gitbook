## Fixed

* Fixes an **indexing bug** where objects would be index in all versions. The order of the versions was random, so that we could not guarantee that the latest version of the object is indexed. If this problem occurs, you can see wrong pool counts after pool changes or do not find objects with their latest data as they are not indexed. **A full re-index is recommended after applying this update**. This update is recommended for all users.
* Fixed error reporting when **connecting to an S3** storage location. Before a session connect error would not be properly reported.
* Fixed `fylr restore` with no `base_config.json` in `manifest.json`. Before we would try to load an non existing file and error out.
