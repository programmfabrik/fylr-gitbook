## New

* Introduced a busy state. If the fylr server has run out of db connections, we limit the wait time for a free connection to 3 seconds. If that times out, fylr repsonse with a http status 503 (server temporarily unavailable). Clients are ask to retry after 5 seconds (http header "Retry-After").

## Fixes

* Windows: Fixed installation as service under Microsoft Windows
* Fixed multiple concurrent downloads which block a db connection by use finer grained transactions. This could result in killed Pods in Kubernetes installations where a liveness probe could time out because the system ran of of db connections.
