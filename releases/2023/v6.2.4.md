## New

* More events are written: USER_LOGIN, USER_LOGOUT, FILE_DOWNLOAD, OBJECT_DOWNLOAD
* Events store the remote address of the accessing user (IP address). The remote addresses can be removed from the event using a janitor setting.  
* Web server supports redirects for legacy deep links. This can be configured in fylr.yml. 
* Support for OpenID discovery endpoint.

## Improved

* JSON will no longer escape HTML special characters.
* Support TIFF (and other non browser displayable formats) files in base config, such as logo & background.
* Reduced amount of database accesses for determining the current cache id.
* /inspect/system/queues now shows the queues in the order of worker priority.
* Object loading speed improvements.
* Set API token cookie to leverage browser caching for thumbnails.
* Support email sending via smtp-relay.gmail.com.
* Improved plugin custom error management.

## Fixes

* Permissions on endpoint /api/eas are checked more thoroughly, taking reverse objects into account.
* Preview generation for video no longer relies on ffmpegthumbnailer on Windows. This program is hard to come by on that platform, so fylr now uses ffmpeg to render the preview image.
* Priority management for the file worker queue was fixed. Now, the sorting is correct and the most important jobs are picked up first.
* Change password page now renders correctly.
* User check for /api/settings/purgeall fixed.
* Users language in some emails was not set correctly.
