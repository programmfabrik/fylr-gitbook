We forgot to bump the version number in `6.6.3`, this one has `6.6.4` set correctly.

## Improved

* Make **file workers faster** when picking up a new job. A new index makes it possible to pick up jobs faster. This becomes relevant on huge file queues (after migration or re-sync) where the queue is filled with more than **100k jobs**. This patch also switches the locking to a different lock which avoids the otherwise harmless error message in the Postgres log: _ERROR: could not obtain lock on row in relation "file_queue"_.

## Fixed

* **/api/config**: When storing event `BASE_CONFIG_UPDATE`, we now store the **url path RFC compliant**. Before, the format was using a "sloppy" approach, same found in Go stdlib where " " is accepted as part of a path.
