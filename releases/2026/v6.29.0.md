## Server

### Improvement

* **/api/db**: Use faster [method](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jackc/pgx/v5#Conn.CopyFrom) for bulk inserts. This should result in a moderate speed up for bigger new data injects. [c23955823]
* **Format PPSX**: Support for `PPSX`. This is a `PPTX` file (Microsoft Powerpoint) which directly starts a presentation. The file extension `.ppsx` is now supported in class `office`. [f11eb0fd5]
* **Error reporting**: Replaced AuthSessRequired with UserRequired. Changed status code for user required from 400 to 401. [7d2f009d1]
* **Extension Plugins**: Send less information in `%info.json` to make it more compatible with Windows command lines. Also removed white space, to safe space. This patch removes the property `plugin` from `%info.json`[0a3d283af]
* **/api/collection/...**: Support `skip_index` to not queue index jobs. [2f3677048]
* **fylr restore**: New flag `--skip-reindex` allows to skip the re-index at the end of the restore. Also use the new `skip_index` feauture when uploading collection objects to speed up restore. [2f3677048]

### Fixed

* **fylr convert**: Fixed `--width` and `--height` parameter. This broke after the introduction of **VIPS** support in `6.22.0`. This feature is not directly used in a **fylr** with standard file worker configuration. [129cdb4e6]
* **/api/export**: Fixed exporting `XLSX` with thumbnails from reverse linked objects. [d9dc05f28]
* **/api/db**: Fixed parsing of numbers like `-6e+10` is now working for type `number` and `integer.2`. [7e82736f7]

## Frontend
### New

- **Collection Picker**: New functionality has been added to allow objects to be added to collections from the main search and detail views. A new contextual option called **Add To Collection** is now available. This option includes two new features: a collection selector that allows searching any collection in the system that the user has access to, and a quick access section showing the 5 most recently used collections. This enables users who are browsing a set of objects to quickly add them to previously used collections. The **Recent Collections** section is persisted per browser / per user.
- **Panel Mask Splitter**: A new option has been added to panel-type mask splitters to remember the panel state (open/closed). This state is persisted per browser / per user.
- **Save and New**: A new **Save and New** button has been added to the editor sidebar in the lists panel. This new button saves the current object and reloads the editor to create a new object.

### Improvement

- **Refresh Session**: Improvements have been made to how the user session is identified and refreshed. This change resolves an issue where long editor sessions could result in a "Session Unauthorized" error.
- **Mask Editor**: The behavior of the mask editor has been improved when unknown mask splitters are present in a mask (e.g. mask splitters implemented in plugins that are not loaded). They can now be deleted correctly and no longer cause the mask to become corrupted.
- **Variant Editor**: A new checkbox has been added when creating a new variant from the variant editor to automatically set the new variant as the default variant.
- **Search Input**: Improvements have been made to how different types of searches are processed in the search input.
- **Export Manager**: New descriptive texts have been added to the export manager.
- **License**: A new property called **Email Contacts** has been added to the license.
- **README in Plugin Manager**: Rendering of READMEs in the plugin manager has been improved when the plugin supports this new feature.
- **Background Tasks**: It is now possible to select searches that currently return no results as parameters for background tasks.

### Fixed

- **Sidebar**: Fixed an issue where, in certain situations, the detail sidebar opened empty when reopening a previously loaded object.
- **Field Visibility**: Fixed a bug where field visibility settings were ignored in the detail view.
- **Linked Objects**: Fixed a bug where using linked objects in the expert search incorrectly displayed a missing permissions message.
- **CSV Importer**: Fixed an issue when importing empty values in Date Range columns. These imported values are now evaluated correctly and clear the current value when performing an object update.
- **Date Range Column**: Fixed the display of Date Range fields with text representation in the table view. Additionally, automatic recognition of ranges from text has been improved to allow months starting with lowercase letters.
- **Linked Object**: Fixed an error when trying to load linked object fields as selectors when they contained purged or deleted objects.
- **Variant Editor**: Fixed a bug that occurred when closing the variant name prompt modal.
- **Double Number Fields**: Fixed a bug where double-type fields were not rendered in the detail panel when the value was between 0 and 1.
- **Collections with Pincode**: Fixed the error handling logic when entering an incorrect pincode in a collection.
- **Trash**: Fixed the object counters in the trash list nodes, which were reacting incorrectly to system events.
- **Main Search**: Fixed an error that caused the main search to execute incorrectly when the Geo-JSON Map was installed but not active.

## Plugins

- **Geo-JSON Map**: **IMPORTANT**: The URL used to receive automatic updates for this plugin has been updated. Please, if you have this plugin installed, copy again the URL indicated in the README of the public repository: https://github.com/programmfabrik/fylr-plugin-geo-json?tab=readme-ov-file#installation. Do not use the releases section of the public repository if you want to receive the latest updates. General improvements have been made to the plugin’s behavior, and proper support has been added to display hierarchical objects.
- **Custom Mask Splitter – Show References**: A new option has been added to modify how references displayed in the mask splitter are sorted, allowing sorting to be selected based on specific fields.
- **Obscure Images Tool**: General fixes have been applied to the plugin. Variants will now be correctly named when no name is provided during creation. Additionally, the version used by the plugin is now correctly locked while the plugin is active, preventing visual bugs when resizing the window during use.
