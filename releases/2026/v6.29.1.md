## Server

### New

* **TLS support**: The new `fylr.services.webapp.tls.letsEncrypt.CA` allows to
  set an alternative [ACME issuer](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/caddyserver/certmagic#ACMEIssuer) to _Let's Encrypt_. [e0197de61]

### Improved

* **/api/xmlmapping**: The mapper was changed to keep information of nested
  tables together. Before we would render _mat1, mat2, remark1, remark2_, now we
  render _mat1, remark1; mat2, remark2_. The grouping is hard-coded to use `; `
  on the top level and `[ ... ]` for deeper levels. This also checks the field
  names. Before any string was accepted, now this is matched against supported
  mapping fields. Also, this fixes mapping field names for nested inside linked
  objects. Before this was wrongly rendered without the `_nested:` prefix for
  the nested table main. With theses patches the API requires fixed text fields
  `text_fixed` and `deep_link_url` to come before or after the data fields.
  Also, render `deep_link_url` with link to frontend as fallback. If the deep
  link url is not set, render a link to the frontend detail page for the
  rendered object. The deep link is set to the actual file if the mapping is
  used to fill a metadata filemapping. Also, add replacement for obj `%_uuid%`
  in `text_fixed`. [709dec348] [0a8b3deb9] [bed769db4] [560f396d7]
* **fylr backup/restore**: Migrate login & password base config from easydb 5.
  Also keep pool ids the same between source and target. Correctly migrate
  groups assigned by `sso` from easydb 5 to **fylr**. In **fylr+* the type of
  this connection is called `saml`. [72e2d5795] [ec16c2986] [c4bf31f22]
* **/inspect/files**: Improved filter for local / remote versions. [bd42b1438]
* **Reverse Proxy**: The reverse proxy configurable in `fylr.yml` now supports
  host-less targets. [33f2b7814]
* **/eas**: To avoid erroneous copies from the alleged `/eas` endpoint, **fylr**
  now responds with `400 Bad Request` to the easydb 5 file endpoint. [e447b17a2]
* **/inspect/objects**: Add a specifc filter prefix `sid:` to filter by system
object id only. This is used to show all versions of a n object. In
`/inspect/objects/OT/ID` a link to show _All Versions_ of the object was added.
[d822bf717]
* **/api/objects**: If an object has no best mask configured, return a
  permission error (`403 Forbidden`) instead of `400 Bad Request`. With the
  `403` the frontend will not show the error in the object share dialog, but
  assume that no access has been configured, which is arguably the case.
  [741a1dabf]
* **Hotfolder**: Create directory without errors. The hotfolder creates
  directories and it could happen (via shared directories) that it tried to
  create a directory which was created by another process already. [f3698fa72]
* **/api/export**: Merge existing `*:secret` in transport options. If an updated
  export contains transports with secrets (key ends in `:secret`) in its
  options, merge these secrets from existing transports if they are not send in
  the update. [41b6a7284]
* **POST /api/db**: For plugins, skip linked objects `READ` permision check.
  When reading back data from plugins, the read back is using the `_all_fields`
  mask, regardless if the user running the request is allowed to do so or not.
  Before this patch, the permission for the linked objects inside the payload
  (`READ`) were checked which made the `_all_fields` feature unusable in some
  configurations. This patch relaxes the permission check when reading back from
plugins. Plugins are now allowed to link to object without permiss ion checks.
[34f1c1f8f]
* **/api/export[CSV/XLSX]**: Fixed export of pool columns. This patch uses the
  users frontend language to export the pool column and all configured frontend
  languages if `all_languages` are given in the export. Also `_pool_id` column
  is sorted properly as system column before all user columns. Also, filter
  language selection for textual information in daterange fields. [413fe3e62]
  [3ce25120e]
* **IIIF Presentation**: No longer use `sequences` to display pages of `PDF` and
  other office files. Also, skip empty required statements. [5d4d08195]


### Fixed

* **DELETE /api/collection**: Fixed for collection users with pin code.  If
  collection users are deleted alongside with a collection and they had used
  their pin before, deleting would fail with a db error. This patch removes the
  pin codes of users before they are archived or deleted. Un-archived users will
  be forced to re-enter their pin codes. [afc81fcb1]
* **/inspect/files/FILE-ID**: Fixed a bug which prevented the page from
rendering if the file was only linked in historic versions a nd not in the
current version. [d822bf717]
* **POST /api/db[groupmode]**: Fix for plugin callbacks where the plugin returns
  unchanged data. f a plugin returns all data from group mode modified plugins
  without actual changing any data, fylr would discard that data but not set the
  `_all_fields` mask back to the received mask, causing the permission check to
  save objects to fail for non-root users. [66ed1f51c]
* **/api/search**: Don't assume `READ` permissions for collection owners. The
  previous code would assume that all collection owners have `READ` permission
  to all objects in the collection. That is not the case. `READ` permissions can
  be shared via ACL by a collection but simply owning a collection does not
  generate `READ` permissions. This was correctly covered by other places in
  fylr where permissions are checked, but the search had it wrong. This brings a
  partial re-index of all collectios. Collection owners which can no longer
  access objects which they previously could, can now no longer find (and
  access) these objects using the search. Higher permissions than READ were not
  affected by this bug. [d318ef456]
* **Frontend Languages**: Fixed support for `tvl-TV` frontend langugage. [4ae9866e0]
  [fff08ce7c]
* **DELETE /api/pool**: Fixed deleting pools owned by non-root users.
  [d59c545b1] [0fe12fb72]
* **Indexer**: Fixed for new object saves during running re-index. The indexer
  would not index the correct objects if a re-index filled the queue with lots
  of jobs and while that queue was still being worked on, a object got re-saved.
  Now the indexer would index the newer version of the object followed by the
  older version (queued by the re-index). [6cf8ede87]
* **/api/epxort**: Fixed single file exports for certain batch sizes. If the
  number of exported objects exceeded the batch size and "one file per object"
  was selected, duplicate filename would be generated. This would lead to a
  database FK violation and an errorneous export. [df8524746]
* **/api/collection**: Ignore unsupported
  `collection.create_object.update_policy`. If for nested fields and unsupported
  `update_policy` is sent, accept it and rewrite it to the only supported on
  _create_version_. This helps with migrations from ez5 where the policy
  _create_version_preferred_ is found in some collections. [054aee56a]

## Frontend

### Improved

* **Cross Server:** The label that displays the target server in cross server mode now allows copying the full cross server URL when clicking on it.
* **Languages:** Support for tvl-tv has been added to the frontend.
* **Admin Message:** The processing of admin messages has been improved to prevent code injection in messages.
* **Metadata Mapping Manager:** The logic for moving field tags within the form has been improved. It is now possible to move and remove them from the XML form simply by dragging them. Additionally, validation has been added for the new limitations introduced in the backend. The validation now indicates which field has the error and highlights it in red for easier identification.
* **Export Transports:** Support has been added for properties marked as `:secret`. This allows adding properties where the server will not send the information back, which is useful for passwords and API keys that should not be displayed again to the user.
* **Tooltips:** The way tooltips are displayed in some menus has been improved to prevent them from covering menu options.
* **Pane Header:** A small improvement has been added to allow collapsing the quick access menu by clicking on the panel title.

### Fixed
* **Search Lists:** Fixed a bug that caused all hierarchy levels to appear expanded when the user had a partial pool selection in the pool selector.
* **Linked Objects:** Fixed the logic that checks whether a reference to a linked object is no longer valid. This issue caused errors when opening the detail/editor in certain scenarios.
* **Save And New:** Fixed the editor reload after using the new "Save and New" button on a record that had previously been copied from another one.
* **CSV Importer:** Fixed the mapping of localized strings inside nested fields. The bug caused multiple localized string values to be merged into a single field at the first nested level.
* **MaskMemoryManager:** Fixed the initialization of the mask memory system. In certain situations, the manager was not initialized, causing errors when loading the detail view or the editor sidebar.

## Plugins

### custom-mask-splitter-detail-linked

This plugin was renamed internally due to technical reasons. If the plugin was
installed in fylr under the name `custom-mask-splitter-detail-linked`, disable
and delete this plugin in the plugin manager. Make sure to install and enable
the new version with the name `easydb-custom-mask-splitter-detail-linked-plugin`
using the same release url.

### Mapbox Token Configuration Changes

The following plugins:
- gn250
- geonames
- dante
- gnd
- georef

As of version **6.29.1**, the **Mapbox token is now configured per plugin in the base configuration**.
- For backward compatibility, specifying the Mapbox token in the data model / form is still supported for now.
- Going forward, the token **should (and eventually must)** be set in the base configuration.
- A future release will remove the fallback to the data model / form.
- An updated data model will then be deployed to the object store to ensure all maps are displayed correctly.
