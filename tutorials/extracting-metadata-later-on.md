  While the metadata mapping profiles can only be applied when uploading files,
  sometimes it's necessary to extract and import XMP/IPTC/EXIF metadata after
  the files were already uploaded to fylr.

## Extracting Metadata using the ScriptExecuter

If you want to extract XMP/IPTC/EXIF metadata from files that have already been uploaded, you can do so by using the ScriptExecuter. Simply search for the files you want the metadata for and then click on the 3-dot-menu for the search and click "Run Script".

The ScriptExecuter offers different plugins. For this specific case, we need to choose the plugin "Download Metadata".&#x20;
