3. Make sure both the plugins "**Server PDF Plugin**" and "**PDF Creator Plugin**" are marked as **enabled**.

### Create at least one PDF template

4. Go to **Rights Management** (the 3 people icon, _NOT_ the gear cogs icon) - **Object Types** - choose one object type - go to the tab named **PDF Creator** (see screenshot)

&#x20;![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>) (click to enlarge)

5. Click the **+** button.
6. Name your template.
7. Do not forget to click **Save** at the end.

### Create a PDF

8. Go to **Lists** - **Object Types** - choose a type with template - Select one Object - right click - **Print**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png>) (click to enlarge)

9. In **Custom Layouts** - open the dropdown - choose one (pdf template 1 in below example) - click **Print**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>) (click to enlarge)



Then a PDF is created and downloaded.

If the PDF is too empty, you can edit the template and add content: **Rights Management** (the 3 people icon) - **Object Types** - choose the object type - go to the tab named **PDF Creator**.
