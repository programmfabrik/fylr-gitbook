# Importing Files

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to learn how to set up an upload collection, please read "[Setting Up An Upload Collection](setting-up-an-upload-collection.md)".
{% endhint %}



**Once** an **upload collection** was **set up**, go to the **settings** of the **collections** and **copy** the **URL** to connect with the **Hotfolder** or **File System Connect**:

* **right click** on the desired **collection**
* "**Settings**"
* go to the tab "**Hotfolder & File System Connect**"
* **copy** the desired **URL** (either "Hotfolder URL" or "File System Connect URL")



## As a Mac User

As a **Mac user**, **right click** on **Finder** and choose "**Connect with Server**". **Paste** the Hotfolder or File System Connect **URL** and click on "**Connect**". Then **connect** as a **guest**. Now you can **drag** your **files** into the **folder**. The **folder** will **stay** under "**Locations**" until you disconnect it.



## As a Windows User

As a **Windows user**, you can simply use the **Windows Explorer** (not the Internet Explorer). **Open** the **Windows explorer** and **right click** on "**This PC**" or "**Network**". In the menu choose "**Map Network Drive**". **Paste** the Hotfolder or File System Connect **URL** and click on "**Finish**".

**Alternatively** you can use [**Cyberduck**](https://cyberduck.io/webdav/) (a free program that is a dedicated webdav client) to connect to the Hotfolder or File System Connect.&#x20;
