# Setting Up An Upload Collection

{% hint style="info" %}
In case you cannot access the described features, please talk to your administrator and make sure your FYLR installation is [set up properly](preparations-before-usage.md).
{% endhint %}



The **Hotfolder** and **File System Connect** are only **available** through **collections**. For a **general** **description** of collections, please read "[**Collections (& Presentations)**](../../for-users/quick-access/collections-and-presentations.md)" first.&#x20;

Please follow the **steps** to **create** an **upload** collection:

* in the [**quick access**](../../for-users/quick-access/) create a **new** collection by clicking on the **plus** button in the lower **left** and give the collection a **name**
* **right** **click** on the **collection**
* click on "**Settings**"
* open tab "**Upload Settings**"
* check "**Enable Upload**"

Then you have to **choose** the **object type** you want to create records with, the **pool** the files should be saved in, the **mask** you want to work with, the **field** for the **files** and a **metadata mapping** to extract metadata. For a **detailed description** of each option, please continue [**here**](../../for-users/quick-access/collections-and-presentations.md#upload-and-file-system-connect).

With the **mode**, you decide wether only **new records** should be **created** for the uploaded files or if **existing records** should be **updated** with the uploaded files. For a **detailed description** of these options, please continue [**here**](../../for-users/quick-access/collections-and-presentations.md#upload-and-file-system-connect).

Once you're **done**, click "**Activate**" to **save** the changes and then **copy** either the **Hotfolder URL** or **File System Connect URL**.

You then can **close** the **dialogue** and **continue** with [**importing the files**](importing-files.md).
