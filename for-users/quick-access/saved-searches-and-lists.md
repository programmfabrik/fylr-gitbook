# Saved Searches (& Lists)

## Saved Searches

Unlike the collections, saved searches save the **search request** instead of specific records. Meaning, when opening a saved search a new search will be started and the search result can be different to the search result when saving the search.

Users with the system right "**Fixed saved searches for editors**" can access 3 pre-defined saved searches.&#x20;

| SAVED SEARCH             | DESCRIPTION                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Created or updated today | Shows all records that were either created today or updated today by the logged in user. |
| Created today            | Shows all records that were created today by the logged in user.                         |
| Updated today            | Shows all records that were updated today by the logged in user.                         |



Users with the system right "**Saved Searches**" can access their saved searches here. To save a search, use the **three dot menu** in the search, click "**Save search...**" and set a **name** for the search so you can identify the saved search later (duplicate names are allowed but not recommended). The **settings** from the "**Sources**" menu and the **search** **terms** in the search bar will be **saved**.

By clicking on the **saved search** in the quick access, a **search** with the same request will be **started** (the settings for the "Sources" and the search terms in the search bar will be restored). You can then **modify the search** by removing or adding search terms or filter the result.

Use the **right click** on a saved search to access the following **options**:

| OPTION | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Share  | Share the saved search with other users. For the settings please see the [collection sharing options](collections-and-presentations.md#sharing). |
| Rename | Rename the saved search.                                                                                                                         |
| Delete | Delete the saved search.                                                                                                                         |



## Lists

Lists, like keywords, persons or locations, can be added to the quick access by administrators ("Object Types" > "Show in Quick Access"). They will be shown as an **alphabetical list / hierarchy** with a count for each record (. **Clicking** on a keyword for example will **start a search** and show all records of the main search that are **linked** to this keyword. **Long** **lists** will automatically be **grouped** in chunks of **50 records**, showing the first and the last record of the chunk as a superordinate group.

{% hint style="info" %}
Lists will only be shown to users who have at least read permissions for the list.
{% endhint %}

Use the **right click** on a record in the list to access the following **options**:

| OPTION         | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quick View     | Opens a popover with details of the record.                                                                                                       |
| Use in Search  | Beams the record in the search bar and starts a search for all records that link to this one. Same as clicking on the record in the quick access. |
| Show in Detail | Opens the details of the record in the detail view on the right.                                                                                  |
