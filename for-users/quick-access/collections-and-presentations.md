  Collections are like personal folders to collect records. They can be turned
  into presentations, shared with others and can be used to upload files.
  Collections can be structured as a hierarchy.

# Collections (& Presentations)

## Working with Collections

There are multiple ways to **create** collections and **add records** to collections. The most common one is to use the little **plus button** on the lower left in the quick access. Click on the plus button to create a new collection on the top level. You can **drag** any collection on another collection to **move** the collection below another collection. Alternatively you can use the **right click** on a collection to create a new collection below the selected one (see [options](collections-and-presentations.md#collection-options)).&#x20;

In the search result you can also use the **right click** on single records or on a selection of records to create a new collection on top level ("**Add to new collection**") and add them to the newly created collection. When in the search result, you can also select one or multiple records and **drag them onto a collection** in the quick access to add them to already existing collections. Use the right click on single or multiple records in the search, go to "**Remove from collection**" and click on the collection you want to remove the records from.

When dragging records from one collection to another, you can choose if the records should be **copied** to the other collection (and remain in the opened collection) or **moved** to the other collection (and be removed from the collection you're currently viewing).

To view the content of a **collection** side by side with the **search result**, open the collection and then click on the **little icon** on the upper right next to the "X". Click the same icon again, to close the split view. Click on the "**X**" or the name of the collection in the quick access to **close** the collection.



## Collection Detail

**Click** on a collection or presentation to open the collection and **view it's content**.&#x20;

### Sharing

By sharing a collection you can give other users, groups or anonymous users **access to a collection and its content** and grant them permissions they'd usually wouldn't have. Collections can be shared with multiple users by adding multiple permissions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note: users require the system right "**Collection Sharing**" to be able to share collections and they can only share the permissions they are allowed to ("**grantable**" has to be set for each permission they should be able to share with others).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Use the **plus** button on the bottom left and choose between:

| OPTION                        | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Share with user/group/email   | Choose this option when you want to share the collection with a specific user, a user group or with an email that doesn't exist in the system yet. Only users with the system right "**Create email user**" are allowed to share a collection with an email as this creates a user account for the email. |
| Create anonymous sharing link | Choose this option when you want to create a link for external users that don't have and don't require a user account. Everyone who has this link can access the collection.                                                                                                                              |

| User/Group/Email  | Choose a specific user, a user group or an email that doesn't exist in the system yet to share the collection with. Only users with the system right "**Create email user**" are allowed to share a collection with an email as this creates a user account for the email. |

| Permissions          | Chose a permission preset or define individual permissions (only available for users with the system right "**Allow to set custom sharing permissions**".                                                                                                                  |



You can change the **order** of the shares by using the **drag** handle at the beginning of each permission. This does not affect the permissions, it's just a visual change. The shares and sharing links are **valid indefinitely** **unless** the **expiration date** has been reached, the share has been **disabled** (in the additional options) or the share was **deleted** (using the "**minus**" on the bottom of the sharing menu).

Use the "**Copy row**", "**Copy all rows**" and "**Paste rows**" to copy & paste permissions within a collection. Copying an anonymous sharing link will result in a new sharing link with the same settings.

As an additional protection a **pin code** can be set for a collection. Users who open the collection have to **enter** the pin code to **get final access** to the collection and its content. The pin code has to be at least **3 characters** long and can consist of numbers, letters and special characters.&#x20;

By default, permission will be **inherited** by the subordinate collections, meaning the permissions you define for a collection also grant users access to the subordinate collections. Activate "**Ignore permissions of the superordinate collections**" so that the permissions are not inherited from above.

Use "**Activate**" to save the changes and prevent the dialogue from closing. Use "**Save**" to save your changes and close the dialogue.



### Upload & File System Connect

Collections can be used for **uploads**, so that all uploaded files will be linked to the collection. You can define if new **records** should be **created** for each uploaded file, or if already existing records should be **updated** with the uploaded file. Use the following **settings** to define the **behavior** of the upload.

{% hint style="info" %}
To set up an upload collection, the user needs the **permissions** to create records and "read" permission for at least one pool.

## Presentation Settings

Collections can be turned into presentations by clicking on "**Presentation**" in the context menu of a collection. The content of the collection can be organized on **slides**, **presented** **online** and **downloaded** as a Microsoft **PowerPoint** file (.pptx).

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note, to download the presentation as a Microsoft PowerPoint file, the plugin "easydb-presentation-pptx-plugin" has to be enabled in the Plugin Manager.
{% endhint %}

You can choose between the following **slide types** when adding new slides using the little **plus button** in the overview:

| TYPE                    | DESCRIPTION                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text only               | Adds a new slide with a headline and a text field.                         |
| One record              | Adds a new slide where you can place one record.                           |
| Two records             | Adds a new slide where you can place two records next to each other.       |
| One record & text       | Adds a new slide where you can place one record and add a text next to it. |
| Add all missing records | Adds a new slide (type "One record") for each (remaining) record.          |



Slides can be **deleted** by clicking the little **minus button** in the overview whereas the little **bin** icon on the slide only r**emoves the record** **from the slide**. Use **drag & drop** to change the **order** of the **slides**. For records with **multiple files**, a little navigation appears in the lower left of the presentation and lets you **choose** the file you want to display. Add the same record to another slide to display another file from the record.

In the **options** of the presentation (click the **settings** **icon** in the overview) you can define if the **standard info** of each record should be shown as a caption below the record in the presentation (default) or not.&#x20;

Click on "**Start presentation**" to enter the fullscreen mode and **view** the presentation in your **browser**. You can **navigate** the slides by using the **keyboard** (left & right and space goes to the next slide) or the "**left**" and "**right**" buttons on the bottom of the screen. Click on "**Detail**" to open the detail view of the shown record and access all available data. To **close** the presentation, click on the "**X**" in the upper right corner.
