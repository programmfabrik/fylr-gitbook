# Quick Access

## Access

The quick access is available for every user with the system right "**Access to collections only**" or "**Access to search**". To be able to create collections the user needs the system right "**Manage own collections**" and to be able to save search requests the system right "**Saved Searches**".

## Structure

The quick access is divided into "[**Collections**](collections-and-presentations.md)" (which includes "**My Collections**" and "**Shared Collections**") and "[**Searches**](saved-searches-and-lists.md)" (which includes "**Saved Searches**" and **lists** that were enabled for the quick access).

## Filter

Use the search to **filter** your collections, the collections that were shared with you and the saved searches. You can search for the **name** and **description** of the collection, for the name of the saved search and the lists that were enabled for the quick access (standard info only). You cannot search for the records in a collection. To **return** to the full list of collections, searches and lists **empty** the input field or click the **reload** button on the bottom.&#x20;
