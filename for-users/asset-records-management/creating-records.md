# Creating Records

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note, that creating records is only possible for users with necessary permissions. Without the appropriate permissions, the option to create new records will not be available. Users needing permissions should contact their system administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}



In the main navigation, users will find a plus (+) button. Clicking this button opens the "New Records" dialog, where files can be uploaded and records can be created.

On the right, users can upload files either by dragging and dropping them into the designated drop zone or by using the provided buttons to add files, directories, or URLs. Uploaded files can be removed, if uploaded falsely, by clicking on the little trash bin icon.

To the right of the file upload area, the settings panel contains several configurable options that define the properties of the new records. Users must select an appropriate object type from the dropdown menu. Next, users can choose the pool where the records will be stored, typically defaulting to "Standard Pool". The mask that should be used for the records is also selected here.

The settings panel also includes a field for specifying where the files will be stored. If the records involve links to other object types, users can opt to select individual pools for each linked record created by the metadata mapping. The metadata mapping itself is chosen from a dropdown menu, generally defaulting to "Standard".

"Detect Versions", enabled by default, allows the application to detect different versions of files, such as "file.tif" and "file.jpg". There is also an option to skip the duplicate check. Enabling this setting means that all duplicated assets will be uploaded regardless of existing duplicates, and this setting persists across other uploads outside the current dialog.

After configuring these settings and uploading the necessary files, users proceed by clicking the "Next" button at the bottom right of the dialog and continue to the actual input screen.
