# Copying Records

fylr allows you to **copy records** in multiple contexts, providing flexibility to duplicate data, create variations, or save temporary templates for reuse. Records can be copied from the **search results context menu**, within the **sidebar**, and from the **full-screen editor**.

## How to Copy a Record

### **From Search Results:**

* Right-click on the record in the search results.
* Select the desired copy option from the menu.

### **From the Sidebar:**

* Open the record in the sidebar (detail or editor).
* Click the **Copy** button or context menu in the upper right corner and select the desired copy option.

### **From the Full-Screen Editor:**

* While editing a record in full-screen mode, access the **Copy** menu in the upper right corner.
* Choose one of the three copy options to duplicate the record or create a template.

## Copy Options

When copying a record, you can choose from three options, depending on your configuration and requirements. The actual records are only created after saving.

### **Copy with Reverse**

This option is available depending on your configuration. It creates a copy of the record and all reverse linked records. All fields are duplicated exactly as they are, and the new record(s) can be edited independently of the original(s).

### **Copy without Reverse**

Creates a direct copy of the selected record. All fields are duplicated exactly as they are, and the new record can be edited independently of the original. Reverse-linked records are not copied.

### **Copy as Adhoc Template**

Creates a temporary template based on the record. The template is not saved permanently and can be used immediately when creating new or editing existing records. When a new adhoc template is created, any previous adhoc template is overwritten.
