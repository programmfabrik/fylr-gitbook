# Editing Records

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note, that editing records is only possible for users with necessary permissions. Without the appropriate permissions, the option to edit records will not be available. Users needing permissions should contact their system administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}



There are basically two different modes:

<table><thead><tr><th width="257">MODE / EDITOR</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Single Mode / Single Editor</td><td>This allows you to edit one record at a time.</td></tr><tr><td>Group Mode / Group Editor</td><td>This allows you to edit multiple records at a time.</td></tr></tbody></table>

And three different editors:

<table><thead><tr><th width="188">EDITOR</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sidebar Editor</td><td>Editor that opens on the right side of the search. Only allows editing one record at a time.</td></tr><tr><td>Full Screen Editor</td><td>Editor that covers the entire screen. Only allows editing one record at a time.</td></tr><tr><td>Popover Editor</td><td>Small editor that opens when editing records of lists / thesauri.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## How To Access The Editors

You can access the editor by using the context menu in the search. Simply right-click on a record and go to "Edit" and then choose either "In Sidebar" or "In Full Screen". You can also switch from the detail view to the editor by clicking the little edit icon in the upper right. And once you're in the sidebar editor, you can switch to the full screen editor by clicking on the expand button in the upper right.

For the group editor, you first have to select at least two records of the same object type. Then the "Group Editor" option in the context menu of a record is available. If there are multiple object types in the selection, you have to choose which object type you want to edit. For more information please refer to the [group editor](group-editor.md).
