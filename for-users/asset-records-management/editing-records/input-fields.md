# Input Fields

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that further restrictions may have been configured for these fields (such as input length or unique constraints).
{% endhint %}



## Single-Line & Multi-Line Text Field

A **Single-Line Text Field** allows you to input a brief line of text, while a **Multi-Line Text Field** accommodates larger blocks of text (including line breaks), such as descriptions.



## Multilingual Single-Line & Multi-Line Text Field

**Multilingual Fields** allow you to enter and manage texts in multiple languages within a single-line or multi-line text field. For each language an input field with the language code will be displayed.

The available languages are defined by administrators in the [base configuration](../../../for-administrators/readme/languages.md). You can narrow these down in the language settings at the top right.



## String Field



## Date Field

The date field allows the input of a full date (day, month & year), just a month and year, or just a year. Alternatively to the manual input, you can choose the date from a calendar by clicking on the little calendar icon on the right of the field.



## Date Range Field

The date range field allows the input of a start and end date. Each field can accommodate a full date (day, month & year), just a month and year, or just a year. Alternatively to the manual input, you can choose the date from a calendar by clicking on the little calendar icon on the right of the field.

When entering a start date, the end date is automatically set to the same date. The end date can then be modified if needed. If one of the fields is left empty, it means it is an open range.&#x20;

Depending on the data model the date range field supports the textual input of dates. You can switch between the textual input and the field input by clicking on the text "" and "".



## Date & Time Field

The date field allows the input of a full date (day, month & year) with a time (HH:MM:SS), a full date, just a month and year, or just a year. Alternatively to the manual input, you can choose the date and time from a calendar and clock by clicking on the little calendar icon on the right of the field.



## Integer Field

The integer field accepts whole numbers without any decimal places. This type of field is ideal for inputs like counts, quantities, or any scenario where fractional values are not appropriate. You can input values manually or increase/decrease the value using the up and down arrows on the keyboard.



## Decimal Number Field

The decimal number field allows for the entry of numbers that include decimal places. This type of field is essential for inputs that require precision, such as measurements or financial data. Like the integer field, you can manually input values or use the keyboard arrows to adjust the number.



## Double Field

The double field is used to handle floating-point numbers with double precision. This type of field can store very large and very small numbers with decimal points, making it suitable for scientific calculations and high-precision financial data. Values can be entered manually or adjusted using the keyboard arrows.



## File Upload Field

The file upload field allows you to upload one or more files from your local device. This field supports various file types, depending on the [configuration](../../../for-administrators/readme/file-worker.md) and [permissions](../../../for-administrators/permissions/). Each file is processed and stored according to the application's requirements. Users can drag and drop files into the field or use the "Browse" button to select files manually.



## Checkbox (Boolean)

The checkbox field allows you to select or deselect an option. This field is typically used for boolean values (true/false). You can check the box to select a true value or leave it unchecked for false.
