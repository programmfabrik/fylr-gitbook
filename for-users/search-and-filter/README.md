# Search & Filter

## Introduction

fylr offers several tools to search and filter for records. From defining your sources, to powerful full text searches and expert options, this article explains the possibilities.

## Sources

In **Sources**, you define the **data set** that is included in your search. Depending on your system configuration, different object types may be available, such as "Collection Items" or "Media Assets", as well as different pools like "Event Photos", "Stock Photos", or "Department 1".

You can select or deselect multiple pools using keyboard shortcuts:

* Press and hold **CTRL / CMD** to select or deselect individual pools.
* Press and hold **ALT** to select or deselect all subsequent pools.
* Press and hold **SHIFT** to keep subordinate pools unchanged.

If you cannot find the expected results, make sure that **all relevant Sources are enabled**, as disabled sources are excluded from the search.
