# Filter

Filters allow you to **refine search results** by narrowing them down based on specific field values. Only the entries that are **connected to the records in your current search** are shown, ensuring relevant filtering options.

Every enabled **list, thesaurus, and date field** appears as a separate **panel** within the filter sidebar. Opening a panel displays the **ten most frequently used entries**, providing quick access to the most common values (click "More" for a full list of entries). For h**ierarchical fields,** only the **first level** is initially shown, and clicking a parent entry reveals the **subordinate levels**. In addition to user-defined fields, certain **system fields** such as **"Object Types", "Pools", and "Tags"** are always available.

#### Repeatable / Nested Fields

For **nested or multi-value fields**, the filter allows you to define how entries are combined. By default, all fields—including nested ones—use **AND logic**, meaning that only records containing **all selected entries** are shown. For nested fields, you can switch to **OR logic** to include records that contain **any of the selected entries**. This flexibility makes it easier to refine complex searches without excluding relevant records.

#### Pinned Filters

Filters can be **pinned** to the top of the filter panel using the **pin icon**. You can **reorder pinned filters** by clicking on the settings icon and dragging and dropping, or remove them by **unpinning**. This feature is particularly useful for keeping **frequently used filters** easily accessible across different searches.
