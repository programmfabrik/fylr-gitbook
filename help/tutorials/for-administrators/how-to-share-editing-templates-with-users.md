# Using editor templates

{% hint style="info" %}
**Root access is required for the configuration and maintenance of templates**
{% endhint %}

In the detail view, enter the editing mode of a record you want to use as a template (the template can be changed afterwards!)

In the top toolbar, you will find the templates context view. Here you can save the currently open record as a template and

* Template can be created just for the currently logged in user (default, listed on top)
* Save as template to share with other user groups (template will be prefixed by groupname)
* Customize, rename and preview existing templates

{% hint style="info" %}
You can edit, delete, preview existing templates shared with groups in the Tab "Editor Templates" in the  [Rights Management ](../../../for-administrators/permissions/groups.md)configuration (in your specific group)
{% endhint %}

### Copying Records

#### With / without reverse

Use the currently open record as a template for a new record. Include or exclude other records referencing this record by selecting to copy with or without reverse.

The editor is then replaced with an exact copy of the original record, ready to be saved as a new record, after further editing or immediately.

#### As adhoc templates

Adhoc templates are quick, temporary templates. With an adhoc template available, when opening the dialogue the application of adhoc templates will be enabled.
