In the top toolbar, you will find the templates context view. Here you can save the currently open record as a template and

* Share the template with other user groups
* Template can be created just for the currently logged in user (default)
* You can customize, rename and preview existing templates&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can edit, delete, preview existing templates shared with groups in the Tab "Editor Templates" in the  [Rights Management ](../../../for-administrators/permissions/groups.md)configuration (in your specific group)
