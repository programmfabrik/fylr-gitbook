# External access: Sharing collections with anonymous users

Sharing folders works a little differently than creating links to file versions, but the general process is similar.&#x20;

#### Permissions for Anonymous Collection users:

* Go to **Rights Management > Groups > Anonymous Collection Users**
* Under **System Rights**, set at minimum _"Access Quick Access only (no search)"_  for the anonymous user to have see the collection

#### Permissions for the Object Types and Masks, possibly more:

* Go to **Rights Management > Pools > Permissions for the relevant pool(s)**
* Create a the **permissions row** for _Anonymous Collection Users_
* Set the required permissions: _View Records_ and _Allowed masks,_ each defining the allowed object types and masks

#### Creating a sharable Collection link for external access:

* **Right-click** on the collection
* Open the **Share** menu
* Click the **plus icon** to create a link for external access
* (Optional) Set additional permissions, for example edit rights or an expiration date
* Copy the link and test it in an incognito tab
