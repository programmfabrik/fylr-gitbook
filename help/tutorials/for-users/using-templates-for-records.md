# Using Templates for Records

## Introduction

For recurring files and metadata, **record templates** help you save time. Templates allow you to store specific metadata and reuse it for both new and existing records.

By default, templates are available only to the logged-in user. With the appropriate permissions, templates can also be shared with other users or user groups.

## Create a Template

Templates can be created in any editor.

To create a template, either:

* Edit an existing record that already contains all the data you want to save, or
* Create a new record and enter all the data you want to include in the template.

In the upper-right corner of the editor, click the **bookmark** icon and select "**Save as Template"**.

A popover appears where you can enter a **name** and an optional **description**. Descriptions are especially helpful when sharing templates with others.

Once saved, the template is available for use (see below).

## Ad hoc Templates

If you don’t want to save a template permanently, you can create an "**Ad hoc Template"**. This option is available via the "**Copy"** icon in the editor.

Ad hoc templates are stored temporarily. When you save another Ad hoc template, the previous one is overwritten.

## Apply a Template

Templates can be applied to both new and existing records.

To apply a template:

1. Click the **bookmark** icon in the upper-right corner of the editor.
2. Select the template you want to apply.

Your personal templates are listed first, followed by templates you have shared with others or that have been shared with you.

After selecting a template, you will be prompted to choose whether the template values should:

* **Overwrite** the existing values in the editor, or
* **Merge** with the existing values.

Remember to **save the record** after applying a template.

## Customize Templates

To manage your templates, click "**Customize Templates"** from the same menu. Here you can:

* Rename templates
* Edit descriptions
* Delete templates
* Change the order of templates
* Preview the template data

## Share a Template

Templates can be shared with other user groups **only at the time of creation**. Existing templates cannot be shared retroactively.

To share a template with a user group, you must have permission to edit the group you are sharing the template with.
