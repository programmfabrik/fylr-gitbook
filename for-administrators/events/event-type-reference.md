  Reference of all server event types: when each event is created and which
  data is stored in its info field.

# Event Type Reference

Every action the fylr server logs is stored as an **event**. Besides the type and the timestamp, an event record can carry:

* the **acting user** — only for event types marked _user-logged_ below, and only if the event's group is enabled in the base configuration (user settings, `user_in_event_group`). Login events always store the user, regardless of this setting. User fields selected in `copy_to_event` are additionally copied into `info` as flat `user.<field>` keys (e.g. `user.login`, `user.first_name`), so a CSV export of events can expand them into columns.
* **record references** — for events about records or base objects: object ID, version, object type or basetype, and the global object ID.
* **`info`** — a JSON object with additional data, different per event type. This is what the largest part of this page describes.
* the **remote address** of the request that caused the event.

Events marked _pollable_ can be retrieved by clients through the event poll API (`GET /api/v1/event/poll`) to react to changes; all events can be searched in the [Events](../events.md) manager and through `GET /api/v1/event/list`.

This reference reflects fylr 6.34.0. Events are listed by their group as defined by the server. The quoted line underneath each heading is the display name the [Events](../events.md) manager shows; event types without one are displayed by their internal name.

The events of this group are not created by the server: the web frontend sends them via `POST /api/v1/event`.

## PLUGIN

Plugins can declare their own event types in their manifest (`custom_events`). These types are registered when the plugin is loaded and behave like frontend events: they are posted through `POST /api/v1/event`, and their `info` is entirely defined by the plugin.
