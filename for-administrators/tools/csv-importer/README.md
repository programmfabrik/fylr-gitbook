# CSV Importer

You can create the data for example in Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers or Notepad++. If you work with Excel or Numbers, you have to save the data as .csv with UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding before importing. Uploading files of type .xls, .xlsx or .numbers is **not** supported.

Please also read the general notes. Under Data types you can read how to format the data in the CSV file. Step-by-step instructions can be found at Examples and all options of the CSV importer are described here.
