# Presets

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note, if a user doesn't have the system right "Allow to Set Individual Permissions for Shares", presets are the only way to share collections or records with others.
{% endhint %}



## Context

First, choose if you want to create a preset for records or for collections.&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="169.5">CONTEXT</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Records</td><td>The preset will be available when adding permissions to individual records. Only available for object types that have "Individual permissions per record" enabled in the data model.</td></tr><tr><td>Collections</td><td>The preset will be available when sharing collections.</td></tr></tbody></table>



## Presets

**Create** new presets by clicking on the **plus** button on the bottom and use the **minus** button to **delete** presets. You can **change** the **order** of the presets by using the little **drag** **handle** that appears before each preset.

Presets can be seen by all users that can share records or collections. Presets can't be hidden for specific user groups.



## Settings

### General

<table><thead><tr><th width="199.5">OPTION</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ID</td><td>ID of the preset.
