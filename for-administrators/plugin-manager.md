# Plugin Manager

## Introduction to Plugins

Some **plugins** will be shipped with **every** release by **default** (type "disk") and can't be removed (only disabled). Others can be **uploaded** as a **ZIP** or via an **URL**. Some plugins are **available** for **all** customers, others were only **developed** for specific **customers**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please refer to the official [Programmfabrik GmbH GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/programmfabrik/repositories) account for all Open Source plugins that were either developed by us or our partners. Download links and documentation for each plugin can be found there.

## Working with the Plugin Manager

Use the **search** to search for the internal or display **names** of plugins and click on a plugin so see all **details**. There, you can also **disable** or **enable** plugins, as well as **upload** a new version or define **automatic updates**:

<table><thead><tr><th width="192.5">OPTION</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Never</td><td>The plugin will not be updated automatically.</td></tr><tr><td>Daily</td><td>The version of the plugin will be checked every 24 hours and if there is a new version available, the plugin will be updated.</td></tr><tr><td>Immediately</td><td>The version of the plugin will be checked every 10 seconds and if there is a new version available, the plugin will be updated.</td></tr></tbody></table>

To **upload** a plugin, click on the **plus** button in the lower left and either upload the **ZIP** file or enter the **URL** to the ZIP file. Please make sure to **enable** the plugin afterwards. To **remove** a plugin, **select** it and click on the **minus** button in the lower left.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note, some plugins may come with custom settings. Please check the [base configuration](readme/plugins.md).
