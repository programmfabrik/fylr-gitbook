## Sections

The base configuration is divided into two **sections**:

<table><thead><tr><th width="154">SECTION</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SYSTEM</td><td>Here you find all settings for the whole system which are identical in every fylr installation. Such as appearance, access, languages and email or export settings. For more information, please see the next pages.</td></tr><tr><td>PLUGINS</td><td>Here you find settings for specific plugins. They can vary from one fylr to another. Plugins can enhance the standard feature set of fylr. For more information, please see chapter "<a href="plugins.md">Plugins</a>".</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Working with the Base Configuration

**Navigate** through the **sections** to **access** all **settings**. **Changes** in the base configuration need to be **saved** using the button in the lower right. When **saving**, your changes in **all** sections will be **saved**.

You can **download** the base configuration by clicking on the **settings** **icon** in the bottom of the first pane. A **json** **file** will be **saved** and can be **uploaded** into another fylr **installation** by clicking the same **icon**.

Please note, when **uploading** a base configuration the **license**, **email** and **object store settings** will be **checked**. If they **differ**, a **message** will be shown and you can **choose** if you want to **overwrite** the **current settings** or if you want to **update** the base configuration **without** the **license**, **email** or **object store settings**.
