# License Management

For all installations a fylr license is required, except for a quick peek and for development.

For more information on licenses, please refer to [fylr Licenses](../../license-management.md).

## Upload your license

In the navigation side bar:

* choose the cog wheels (`Administration`)&#x20;
* then `Base Configuration`&#x20;
* then choose `License Management`
* click on `Upload License File` and choose your license file, typically a text file ending in `.json`
