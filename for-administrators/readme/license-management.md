The licensing system includes an automated warning service to prevent disruption to your fylr instance.

#### Automatic Emails

By default, notifications are sent to the **Administrator Email(s)** defined in **Base Configuration** > **Email.** Additional recipients can be added to the license provided by programmfabrik.
