# Using the fylr inspect page for migrations

The migration using the `fylr backup` and `fylr restore` commands can also be performed in the inspect page for migrations (open `<fylr url>/inspect/migration/` in the browser). This provides a graphical overview to run these commands.

The source instance for the backup can be any **easydb5** or **fylr** instance, even the current fylr instance. The same is true for the target instance of the restore, this can theoretically be the same **fylr** instance, although this is not recommended and you should use another target instance.
